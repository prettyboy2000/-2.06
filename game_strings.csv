str_sub_treasure_hunt_1|Tributore found a map marking the shipwreck of a Spanish galleon loaded with silver and gold. The galleon sank off the shores of Hispaniola.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_2|Alba brought me a map supposedly marking a location where Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of the Incas, buried the treasures he had plundered. The cache is hidden somewhere in the Andes, up the Magdalena river, that flows into the sea near Cartagena.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_3|The map won by Incosa supposedly displays the entrance to a hidden route to Eldorado. The mad Aguirre sought this legendary Land of Gold by the headwaters of the Orinoco, which flows into the sea south of Port of Spain on the island of Trinidad.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_4|The crown of Scotland that Gordon is so obsessed with is supposedly hidden in the middle of Cuba.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_5|Juba seems adamant that the map he has found marks the treasure of Dutch slavers. If that is true, it must be around their island holdings on Curacao and Aruba.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_6|The spirits have convinced Chibchan that the abandoned Huguenot village must be somewhere on Martinique, where the French first established their presence in the New World by building St. Pierre.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_7|The legends that Mayan descendants told to Gober speak of the treasures hidden deep on the Yucatan peninsula, probably not that far from Campeche or Belize.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_8|If the pirate slain by Kirk did not lie, the famed pirate captain Flint buried his treasures somewhere on the Bahamas, not too far from Nassau.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_9|If Bogdan's fellow countrymen are to be believed, the mysteriously missing treasure of the hetman, Pavlo Polubotok, must be hidden on Jamaica, right under the nose of Port Royal's buccaneers.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_10|I might be just the person to discover the secret silver mine of Van Hoorn. Vanhouten swears it should be on the isthmus of Panama, somewhere southeast of Nombre de Dios.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_11|Frogling says that the governor of Barbados has earned a fortune ransoming the English catholic convicts to the Spaniards. His gold should be hidden somewhere east of Cumana.{***}
str_sub_treasure_hunt_12|It is hard to believe that Templar refugees managed to reach the Caribbean two centuries before Columbus. They might have been led by Baphomet indeed, but, in the end, the demon didn't lead them to anything good. Lamore claims the last Templar galley wrecked on the shores of Guadeloupe, east of Basse Terre.{***}
str_main_treasure_hunt|The fragments of the map have clicked together - this is a key supposedly showing the way to the mythic Fountain of Youth. The conquistador, Juan Ponce de Leon, who drew this map a century and half ago, believed the Fountain to be on the peninsula of Florida, west of the modern town of San Agustin.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_1|If you look hard enough, you can indeed make out the shadow of the mighty hull of a galleon several yards beneath the surface. That must be 'Nuestra Seniora de la Concepcion' with her countless treasures aboard.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_2|It appears this is the place marked on Alba's map. After a century, everything is overgrown with thickets. Finding the cache will take a lot of hard work with shovels and picks.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_3|The cave narrows into a natural tunnel, caved in just a few yards further down. You can't tell how deep the cave-in goes. It could last a few feet, or a mile, or more.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_4|This odd mound looks like a possible hiding place for the Royal Regalia of Scotland. All that is left is the trifling task of finding them underneath a few tons of soil.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_5|This clearing obviously used to be a slaver camp, large enough for hundreds of slaves and their Dutch wardens. Judging by the burnt husks of building and scattered bones, one day the wardens' vigilance slipped. The treasures of the slavers may still remain somewhere in the ruins. It's just a matter of finding them...{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_6|Some overgrown ruins are all that remains from the first Huguenot colony. Somewhere in these ruins, the treasures they brought from overseas might still rest.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_7|The Maya ziggurats have long crumbled, but their immense size is still astounding. It could take years to find anything of value in here.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_8|Fifteen skeletons scattered about the clearing make a telling sign of Flint's cache, so long as the legend is to be believed. Might just as well begin digging.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_9|This place looks just like Bogdan's mates were describing. And lo, a broken sabre of typical Eastern design! A hundred stones of gold, just a few feet away - a-digging we shall go!{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_10|This rough-cut tunnel with wooden supports is obviously of artificial nature. Too bad it caved in right beyond the entrance. The digging may cause further collapse...{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_11|It seems the map stolen by Frogling marks this very spot. Give or take a few hundred yards. If you're up for digging out the governor's treasure, you're better off starting right now, so as to finish in time for Christmas.{***}
str_sub_treasure_menu_12|It is hard to say whether these darkening blots underneath are indeed the remains of a medieval galley, buried in silt for three centuries and half. There is only one way to know for sure...{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_1|Suddenly, one of the divers brings wonderful news: he discovered a chest in the rubble! With a lot of effort, a group of soldiers pulls it out of the water - likely the sole spoil of your searches. Prying the rotten lid off, you behold neatly stacked bullions of gleaming silver!{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_2|At the end, one of the soldiers has a stroke of good luck: his shovel hits against some rotten wood. Half an hour of frantic digging later, you behold an old, rotten chest. Prying the lid away, you see a sizable pile of crude gold trinkets.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_3|Shoving another boulder aside, your tired soldiers discover a crushed skeleton in old Spanish armor. His rusty helmet and a few piastres are all that is to be found in here. Looks like the passage to Eldorado is buried for hundreds of yards ahead, and you should let go of your dream of 'The Land of Gold'. The hopes of your soldiers are utterly crushed.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_4|After many hours of digging, a soldier's shovel makes a dull thud against something wooden. The joy of the crew is short-lived, though - the unearthed barrel gurgles instead of jingles and moreover smells strongly of alcohol. A Scottish treasure, indeed! Seldom has a cask full of aged whiskey been received with so little joy.^Beside the cask, the soldiers discover an old but true Scottish blade.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_5|A soldier has discovered some empty space while knocking against a wall of the estate. Picks and crowbars are let loose on the spot, and, sure enough, a few minutes later the cache gives in, releasing a stream of gold coins.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_6|A soldier has discovered some empty space while knocking against a wall of a ruined house. Picks and crowbars are let loose on the spot, and sure enough, a few minutes later the cache gives in, releasing a stream of silver coins.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_7|After many hours of searching, the soldiers discover a half-buried heathen temple. Scattered among the unholy idols, you find some gold figurines, as well as some precious offerings.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_8|A thud of a shovel against the wood sounds like a music to your ears. Digging with their bare hands, the crew quickly unearths a small coffer. Inside you find a small fortune in silver and gold, yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_9|The shovels strike wood, and your soldiers charge the oaken lid protecting the treasure of Hetman Polubotok with the ferocity of true Cossacks. Shockingly, the only thing they find within is a well-preserved sabre.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_10|After many hours of digging, you realize you can't unearth the silver of Van Hoorn without a fulltime mining expedition. All you have found is several ingots buried underneath an overturned trolley.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_11|It took a lot of sweat, but your soldiers managed to find the governor's stash. He earned a nice chunk of gold, it seems - the Spaniards must pay well for their brothers in faith.{***}
str_sub_treasure_found_12|Centuries underwater have ruined the ancient vessel utterly, safely burying its contents. Yet, one diver makes a wondrous and startling discovery: a gold idol of Baphomet himself! A goat-headed figurine with its left hand raised and its right lowered floated as if by itself out of the silt and straight into his arms. The superstitious crew forgets all about the gold and demands you to throw the satanic idol back into the sea.{***}

str_faction_upgrade_description_01|Sometimes, signing up for a military service is the only career left for the urban poor. These slum dwellers can't boast healthy physique or high morale, but as the saying goes, a musket makes everyone equal.{***}
str_faction_upgrade_description_02|These sons of farmers and peasants are used to hard physical labor, the art of wielding a 20-feet pike comes to them naturally.{***}
str_faction_upgrade_description_03|Many seamen dream of becoming marines. Life of a maritime soldier is much more exciting than the dull existence of a sailor, while the chance to end up beneath the waves is about the same.{***}

str_faction_upgrade_description_05|The scouts and hunters who prowl the Caribbean jungles might lack the proper military discipline, but they are excellent shots who need little upkeep and even less formal training.{***}
str_faction_upgrade_description_06|The dragoons, or mounted infantry, are the latest ingenious invention of the European tactical thought. Having hired some advisors from the leading European powers, you can begin training these universal soldiers yourself.{***}
str_faction_upgrade_description_07|Mere half a century ago, a steel breastplate and a helmet were the bare minimum of armor befitting a noble cavalryman. Today, the troops thus equipped are considered heavy cavalry. Although little old-fashioned, these well-armored soldiers armed with broadswords and pistols are able to rout any opposition.{***}

str_faction_upgrade_description_14|Mingling with the pirates is a transgression which can't be excused, as far as the European powers are concerned. Nonetheless, the Brotherhood of the Coast is a force in its own right, and it can be grateful to would-be allies.{***}
str_faction_upgrade_description_15|Even though the Golden Age of conquistadors has long passed, there are still many adventurers in Spain eager to go to the end of the world in search for treasures and glory. Some of them may be lured to the Caribbean with only a hint about Eldorado.{***}

str_ship_upgrade_descr_03|This clever Dutch invention introduced half a century ago allows for better ship control than the traditional tiller.{***}

str_tutorial_map1|Life in the Caribbean is all about social status, and most common venues to increase your standing are consistently displaying your martial mettle or business acumen. Your military renown increases as you defeat enemies on the field and at sea, resulting in promotions which allow you to recruit better troops, order more powerful warships with heavier armament, raid and conquer cities. As for your business reputation, it depends on your cash reserves and trade assets, and the growth of your merchant empire permits you to build plantations and manufactories, order better cargo vessels and pay less taxes. Eventually you'll become recognized enough to be invited by the colonial powers to join their ranks.{***}
str_tutorial_sea1|Use the '{s1}', '{s2}', '{s3}' & '{s4}' keys to steer your ship and change her speed. To fire at enemy vessel in range of your cannons, hit the 'Space' key. Use the buttons at the bottom to fire individual gun decks. Switch to chainball if you want to slow down an enemy ship, or to grapeshot to decimate her crew. You can drop powder kegs as mines if you have enough ammunition reserves, or repair some damage to hull and rigging if you have timber and linen aboard.^In order to board a vessel, close down to it until the boarding prompt comes up, and hold the '{s7}' key until the bar is filled. ^You can command other ships in your fleet by clicking on their icons to the left and selecting an order. At your command, they can attack specific enemies, stop and stay out of battle, lay mines or become fireships.{***}
str_sea_battle_info|You can steer your ship left and right using the '{s2}' and '{s4}' keys. To raise sails and increase your speed, hold '{s1}', to fold sails and slow down, hold '{s3}'.^^There are several ways to fire at enemy vessels. The easiest is to hit the 'Space' key when an enemy is in range of any of your cannons - all the batteries with hostile ships in range will fire at them. That way you can attack more than one enemy at once, as long as they are targeted by different batteries. Alternately, you can click the gun deck icons at the bottom to discharge the batteries individually.^^Your cannons can use 3 kinds of ammunition. Solid cannonballs used by default do the most damage against hulls, and are perfect to sink enemies quickly. They have superior range as well. Alternately, you can load chainshot to wreck enemy rigging and slow it down, or grapeshot to mow down enemy crew in preparation for boarding.^^When you have enough ammunition, you can drop powder kegs as mines. When a ship collides with such a mine, it will be set aflame. You can also repair some of the damage suffered by your hull and rigging, providing you have enough timber or linen in your hold.^^In order to board an enemy vessel, close down to it until the boarding prompt comes up, and hold the '{s7}' key until the bar is filled.^^With additional ships under your command, you can give them orders via calling up the command bar by clicking on their icons on the left side of the screen. You can order them to lay their own mines, attack specific enemies (select a target by clicking on it), stop and keep out of battle, or become a fireship. Fireships lose control and burn down quickly, but if one manages to collide with another ship, that ship is in mortal danger.{***}
str_ranks_info|You rise in rank as you improve your martial fame and business reputation. New military ranks are reached by increasing your renown, which rises as you complete tasks and achieve victories on the field of battle. The larger and harder are your fights, the shorter is your path to glory. As for your business acumen, it is judged best by the jingle of coins: your status increases with your cash reserves, with the amount of trade goods in your warehouses, with the manufactories and plantations you own, and with the cargo capacity of your fleet.^^Normally, you start as a mere sailor. As such, you can only recruit armed civilians such as colonists and hunters, and purchase boat-sized vessels. As you rise in status, so do your opportunities. New military ranks allow you to hire better soldiers and purchase more powerful warships. An increase in business reputation opens access to larger trade vessels and allows to build more manufactories. Famous warriors and influential traders are permitted to outfit their fleets with heavier naval artillery, can purchase letters of marquee and eventually can be invited to join one of the European powers - or the Brethren of the Coast.{***}

str_persuasion_summary_very_bad|You try your best to persuade {s50}, but none of your arguments seem to come out right. Every time you start to make sense, you seem to say something entirely wrong that puts you off track. By the time you finish speaking you've failed to form a single coherent point in your own favour, and you realise that all you've done was dig yourself deeper into a hole. Unsurprisingly, {s50} does not look impressed.{***}
str_persuasion_summary_bad|You try to persuade {s50}, but {reg51?she:he} outmaneuvres you from the very start. Even your best arguments sound hollow to your own ears. {s50}, likewise, has not formed a very high opinion of what you had to say.{***}
str_persuasion_summary_average|{s50} turns out to be a skilled speaker with a keen mind, and you can't seem to bring forth anything concrete that {reg51?she:he} cannot counter with a rational point. In the end, neither of you manage to gain any ground in this discussion.{***}
str_persuasion_summary_good|Through quick thinking and smooth argumentation, you manage to state your case well, forcing {s50} to concede on several points. However, {reg51?she:he} still expresses doubts about your request.{***}
str_persuasion_summary_very_good|You deliver an impassioned speech that echoes through all listening ears like poetry. The world itself seems to quiet down in order to hear you better .

str_retirement_text_1|Too late it becomes obvious that your money won't last for long. Soon, what little you bothered to save is all gone. You try to go back to your adventuring days, but fail time and again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.{***}
str_retirement_text_2|Too late it becomes obvious that your money won't last for long. Soon, what little you bothered to save is all gone. Having lost everything, you are forced to turn to a life of crime in the backstreets of {s9}, making your miserable living by robbing coppers from the poor.{***}
str_retirement_text_3|Too late it becomes obvious that your money won't last for long. Soon, what little you bothered to save is all gone. You end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern trading your war stories that no one ever believes for free drinks and a meal.{***}
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved isn't much, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract attention from potential {wives/husbands}. In time, the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.{***}
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved isn't much, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feasthall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.{***}
str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. Having bought several shops and plantations in and around {s9}, you develop into one of the most prominent merchants in town. Soon, you're a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.{***}
str_retirement_text_7|As a governor, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your manor at {s7}, managing the village and its fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your ruler. The winds of war sometimes force you to rejoin your liege in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and estates, you have few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.{***}
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive estates and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your palace in {s9}, you exchange adventure for politics, and soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your ruler's domains. With intrigue to busy yourself with, a palace to hold balls in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.{***}
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your ruler decrees that you be given an governor's office in his domain. Soon, you complete your move to the village of {s7}, and eventually become one of your liege's close advisors and adjutants. Your renown garners you much subtle pull and influence as well as overt political power. Now you spend your days playing the games of power, administering your settlement, and recounting the old times of adventure and glory.{***}
str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your ruler holds you in high esteem, and a ripple of shock passes through the colonies when he appoints you a governor of {s9}. The power and riches you wield now are matched by few. You quickly become your liege's most trusted advisor, almost his equal and charged with much of the running of his domains, and you reign from your own splendourous palace as one of the most powerful figures in the Americas.{***}

str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_goodnatured|I'm sorry -- I can't just let you ride away. No hard feelings?{***}
str_lord_declines_negotiation_offer_upstanding|That may be, but my duty to my liege requires me to fight against you{***}

str_battle_won_quarrelsome|Hah! We showed those bastards a thing or two, there, didn't we?{***}
str_battle_won_pitiless|Together, we will make the foe learn to fear our names, and to quail at our coming!{***}
str_battle_won_cunning|Now, we must be sure to press our advantage, so that the blood shed today is not wasted.{***}
str_battle_won_sadistic|Now let us strip their dead and leave them for the crows, so that all will know the fate of those who come against us.{***}

str_battle_won_upstanding|Now, let us pray to the Lord for our victory, and mourn the many fine men who have fallen today.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_default|You helped turn the tide on the field, today. Whatever I may think of you, I cannot fault you for your valor.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_martial|{playername}, you have shown yourself a worthy {man/woman} today, whatever your failures in the past.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_quarrelsome|Hmf. Yours is not a face which I normally like to see, but I suppose today I should be grateful for your help.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_pitiless|Your help was most valuable today. I would not imagine that you came to help me out of kindness, but I nonetheless thank you.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_cunning|It would be unwise of me not to thank you for coming to help me in my hour of need. So... You have my gratitude.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_sadistic|Well! How touching! {playername} comes to rescue me.{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_goodnatured|{playername}! I can't say that we've always gotten along in the past, but you fought well today. My thanks to you!{***}
str_battle_won_grudging_upstanding|Perhaps I was wrong about you. Your arrival was most timely. You have my gratitude.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_default|So you're here. Well, better late than never, I suppose.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_martial|We have hard harsh words in the past, but for now let us simply enjoy our victory.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_quarrelsome|If you're standing there waiting for thanks, you can keep waiting. Your help wasn't really needed, but I guess you had nothing better to do, right?{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_pitiless|You have come here, like a jackal to a lion's kill. Very well then, help yourself to the spoils. I shall not stop you.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_cunning|{playername}... Well, I suppose your arrival didn't hurt, although I won't pretend that I'm happy to see you.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_sadistic|Back off, carrion fowl! This was my victory, however hard you try to steal the glory for yourself.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_goodnatured|Oh, it's you. Well, I suppose I should thank you for your help.{***}
str_battle_won_unfriendly_upstanding|Thank you for coming to my support. Now I will be off, before I say something that I regret.{***}
str_troop_train_request_default|I need someone like you to knock them into shape.{***}
str_troop_train_request_martial|They need someone to show them the meaning of valor.{***}
str_troop_train_request_quarrelsome|Fat lazy bastards. They make me puke.{***}
str_troop_train_request_pitiless|They are more afraid of the enemy than they are of me, and this will not do.{***}
str_troop_train_request_cunning|But men, like swords, are tempered and hardened by fire.{***}
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|They need someone with steel in his back to flog some courage into them, or kill them trying.{***}
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads, but I am afraid that they are not quite ready for a battle just yet.{***}
str_troop_train_request_upstanding|It would be tantamount to murder for me to lead them into combat in their current state.{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_default|This is getting ridiculous. Do I have to run you through?{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_martial|I have no objection to a trial of arms, but I would ask you for what reason you attack us?{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_quarrelsome|You're making a big mistake, {boy/girl}. What do you think you're doing?{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_pitiless|Indeed? If you really want to die today, I'd be more than happy to oblige you, but I am curious as to what you hope to accomplish.{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_cunning|Really? I think that you are acting most unwisely. What do you hope to gain by this?{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|What's this? Do you enjoy having your eyes put out?{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you do this? We've got no quarrel, {sir/madame}.{***}
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault, and will protest to your king. Why do you do this?{***}
str_unnecessary_attack_default|I will not hesitate to cut you down if pressed, but I will offer you the chance to ride away from this.{***}
str_unnecessary_attack_martial|I am eager to take you up on your challenge, {sir/madame}, although I will give you a minute to reconsider.{***}
str_unnecessary_attack_quarrelsome|Bah! I'm in no mood for this nonsense today. Get out of my way.{***}
str_unnecessary_attack_pitiless|I am in a merciful mood today. I will pretend that I did not hear you.{***}
str_unnecessary_attack_cunning|I don't see what you have to gain by making an enemy of me. Maybe you should just ride away.{***}

str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his position illegally.{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful ruler. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath to serve {s46}, yet the powerful are not bound by their oaths as do ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order and prevent the war of all against all.{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what's in it for me?{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know if I am still bound.{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my oath to {s46} to be null and void, and dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy.

str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.{***}

str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but perhaps if I bring {s46} your head he will give me an even greater reward.{***}
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet it's true that he did wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my oath to {s46}, yet I also don't think it's right to support injustice.{***}

str_political_philosophy_cunning|Well, it's a harsh world, and it is our lot to face harsh choices. Sometimes one must serve a tyrant to keep the peace, but sometimes a bit of rebellion keeps the kings honest. Circumstance is all.{***}
str_political_philosophy_sadistic|My philosophy is simple: it is better to be the wolf than the lamb.{***}
str_political_philosophy_goodnatured|Well, you should keep faith with your promises, and not do injustice to others. Sometimes it's hard to balance those. Stick with people you trust, I think, and it's hard to go far wrong.{***}

str_quick_battle_troop_1|The term buccaneer derives from the Caribbean Arawak word buccan, a wooden frame for smoking meat, preferably manatee. From this became derived in French the word boucane and hence the name boucanier for French hunters who used such frames to smoke meat from feral cattle and pigs on Hispaniola. English colonists anglicised the word boucanier to buccaneer. About 1630, some Frenchmen who were driven away from the island of Hispaniola fled to nearby Tortuga. The Spaniards tried to drive them out of Tortuga, but the buccaneers were joined by many other French, Dutch and English and turned to piracy against Spanish shipping, generally using small craft to attack galleons in the vicinity of the Windward Passage. Finally they became so strong that they even sailed to the mainland of Spanish America and sacked cities.{***}
str_quick_battle_troop_4|The cuirassiers (from the French word cuirass, armor) are a cavalry corps equipped with light chest armor, the cuirass. They developed in the 16th century in many European countries, and were designed to compensate for the dearth of knights in heavy cavalry. The cuirassier's suit of armor (called 'cuirass armor') was reduced to a half-armor piece which was relatively inexpensive. By the end of 16th century, it consisted only of a helmet and a cuirass proper. Initially, when cuirassiers fought alongside knights, they wielded the same type of sword, but later they switched to using broadswords, and in certain armies, heavy sabers.{***}
str_quick_battle_troop_6|Musketeers form the core of any army. Their shooting skills make their presence on the battlefield decisive, as the tide of battle may be turned by a single musket salvo. However, in melee the musketeers are extremely weak against cavalry or heavy infantry, and therefore must be protected by cavalry units or pikemen.^By the middle of the 16th century, most wars were fought with muskets, a weapon far more effective than its ranged predecessors, specifically the bow and the crossbow. An average person could learn to use the musket fairly quickly. The majority of low-rank musketeers were drawn from townsmen and peasants.{***}
str_quick_battle_troop_10|Pikemen were a key part of European armies for a very long time. While firearms developed, armor was developing as well, and becoming lighter. Eventually, pikemen went into battle wearing only a cuirass to protect them from edged weapons, and a helmet to cover their heads. Pikemen wielded long pikes, hence the name. They fought in a close formation, and were designed to safeguard the musketeers from the attacks of enemy cavalry.^Firearms were still far from perfect. As a rule, after one salvo, musketeers would either meet the enemy in hand-to-hand combat or exchange position with a back rank which had not yet taken a shot. In such circumstances, some infantry corps had to be equipped with armor and cold steel for close-range combat. Some armies employed pikemen into the beginning of the 19th century.{***}
str_quick_battle_troop_11|The era of piracy in the Caribbean Sea began in the 16th century and died out in the 1830s after the navies of nations of Western Europe and North America with colonies in the Caribbean began combatting pirates. The period during which pirates were most successful was from the 1690s until the 1720s. Piracy flourished in the Caribbean because of the existence of relatively lawless British seaports such as Port Royal in Jamaica and the French settlement at Tortuga.{***}

str_npc1_backstory_b|My given name is Francois Tributor, and may never I plot a course through the Caribbean again if I am not the best helmsman in this part of the world! Henry Morgan himself had entrusted me his flagship frigate 'Satisfaction'. It was I who stood at the helm, listening to the Jolly Roger flapping on the wind, as we raided Panama on thirty six ships. An awesome adventure it was. A thousand and half of the Brethren of the Coast vanquished three times as many Spaniards! And the loot! We had to use fifty-seven mules to load all the gold and silver and gems on our ships. But the stars were not on my side...{***}
str_npc2_backstory_b|I am Jose de Alba, a scion of the powerful house of the Dukes of Toledo. At the age of sixteen, I was already a lieutenant of the boarding crew on one of the largest galleons in New Spain. I was to become a captain soon, then a governor of one of the larger forts. By the age of thirty, I expected to return to Madrid and take my rightful place in the Cortes. But a successful man never lacks enemies, and I was not an exception... My detachment was ordered to the village of Kanarakuni near {s21}, to defend it from outlaws. I was all too happy to oblige, for I was in love with a daughter of a local plantation owner.{***}
str_npc3_backstory_b|Life was good at {s21}. We guarded the black slaves on tobacco plantations. But everything good comes to an end, usually sooner than later. The colonel I served was appointed a governor in Mexico, and he decided to take us along. We boarded a galleon and sailed to our new home.{***}
str_npc4_backstory_b|The clan of Patrick Gordon - that's my name, mind you - hails all the way back to good king Bruce. As earls of Scotland, we loyally served the Stuarts, who united England and Scotland together. But then my homeland was usurped by Cromwell the Brewer King. He executed the our rightful monarch and suppressed the scottish nobility brutally. That's why I had to leave my beautiful Maryculter for these torrid waters. Using the remnants of family treasures, I bought a small estate near {s21}, trying to have a life of a common plantation owner.{***}
str_npc5_backstory_b|I born in faraway land of Sanhaja, white men call Senegal. My father Lamtuna chief, most mighty tribe of people! We hunt wild men, sell them to white men who sail big boats.{***}
str_npc6_backstory_b|I grew in the village of Kanea near {s21}. My tribe was peaceful hunters, we wanted no fighting with intruders - until the day the Spanish attacked us. Those cruel men, they burnt our homes and took our women!{***}
str_npc7_backstory_b|My father used to own several tobacco plantations, and was able to pay for my education at the Franciscan college. Having completed my studies, I decided not to return to my home. Instead, I went to the far-off forest village of Mukasai south of {s21}, and spent five years living alongside the savages. Not savages they are, though, just children of the forest eager to absorb my every word.{***}
str_npc8_backstory_b|Used to serve in Royal Navy, I did! 'Til the day I beat the crap outta first mate. Then them wanna 'ang me dead, and I run to freebooters. Them Brethren of the Coast know no better boatswain than John Kirk, shark bite me! Sunk with me ship four times, was captured five and fled every time! Twice to be 'anged, too - by dirty papists and by the froglegs.{***}
str_npc9_backstory_b|I am from Kaniv, the Cossack Sich. The Sich is, well, like this here Tortuga, except on land. We raid by summers, rest on our farmsteads by winters. Well, one Christmas day I drove to a friend's marriage. A fine marriage that was, mounds of salo, a sea of gorilka, a beautiful bride, a brawl all over the village. If only that stupid elder wouldn't get in the way of my fists. One blow, and he drops dead... The elder was a Pole, so I'd got into serious mess. They sent guards after me, and I had to flee.{***}
str_npc10_backstory_b|By the way, permit me to introduce myself. My name is Vanhouten. I am a merchant serving with West India Company. Or used to be... See, I used to be a tulip bulb merchant back in Amsterdam. A few years ago, it was extremely profitable. The bulbs of rare breeds used to grow in price every month. To invest into them meant to earn five guilders for one spent, but it just so happened that the prices plummeted the moment I purchased an immense batch. I was ruined. With the last of my funds, I moved to the Caribbean and purchased a small plantation. Everyone thinks I am growing tobacco here...{***}
str_npc11_backstory_b|I was born on a pirate ship, and spent my entire life at sea. But my parents, being good catholics they were, have raised me to love our great France. And to hate her enemies, too - such as the Spaniards!{***}
str_npc12_backstory_b|Our Order resides in the Mediterranean, on the island of Malta. For decades we, the Knights of Malta, were the best corsairs of the Old World - no Muslim vessel dared to approach a ship bearing the sails with red crosses!{***}

str_npc1_backstory_c|One of the captains had too little blood in his rum to live on, and so admiral Morgan gave me the command of his ship. On our way back, a storm struck our fleet, and the ship entrusted to me was thrown on the reefs. An English corvette then captured us, and I was sentenced to a life of hard labor. Long story short, I escaped and spent several years hiding in some village on Hispaniola. Then, I saw a sail on the horizon. I left everything behind and went to the nearest tavern to go to the sea again. But the years spent in oblivion left their mark. No one remembers Francois Tributor any longer, and I can't get a helm post anywhere. Maybe you could use an experienced helmsman? I won't ask for much.{***}
str_npc2_backstory_c|But the night we arrived, my beloved was brutally strangled, and my second in command claimed I was the murderer! An execution expected me; worse yet, a disgrace to taint my entire family. To defend my good name, I had to escape from my guard. But the case was anything but simple. The intimidated villagers refuse to testify in my favor, the girl's father put a bounty on my head, and my accuser has become a lieutenant himself and never leaves the ship. All I had left to me is to seek a new service.{***}
str_npc3_backstory_c|The time wasn't good for sailing. The Caribbean was ravaged by storms, and us landlubbers suffered all kinds of torments. When the galleon entered a port to resupply, I got a shore leave to have a drink or three in a tavern and wash away my suffering. Coming back to my senses three days after, I realized the galleon is long gone, and I am marooned in an alien port, where nobody speaks Spanish. Soon my purse was the stuff of memories, and I have to keep on the move, offering my services as mercenary to anyone who travels in the direction I need.{***}
str_npc4_backstory_c|But I wasn't fond of slave labor, and my workers, having no fear of a whiplash, grew lazy and unruly. Then one day, while I was out selling sugarcane, a fellow countryman told me the crown of Scotland - the one Cromwell had sworn to destroy - was saved by the patriots and delivered somewhere in the New World. I sold my estate and went out to seek it, but have had no success so far. Now I am out of silver and look for any service.{***}
str_npc5_backstory_c|Father start take me to war when I nine. Once we have no luck, tribe defeated, I captive. White men take me on big water, make me work field on island. I son of chief, I no slave! I make tomo-tomo, death potion, put it to guards food. Then hide on big boat and escape. Now, Massa, I say all I sick and stupid. But I seek chief I make war together and sell live goods!{***}
str_npc6_backstory_c|The people of my tribe went deeper into the forest, where the intruders won't bother them again. And I went to the world of white people, searching for a relic of my folk. The gold figurine of Chatzli, the green-eyed patron god of Kanea people. But the white man's world is too large, and it will take me years to find the relic. There are no forests there and nowhere to hunt, so I seek some kind of service so I can have something to eat. I am gifted at healing...{***}
str_npc7_backstory_c|After living five years among the natives, I returned to civilized world, but my father, offended with my refusal to run the family business, disinherited me. Since then, I wander, looking for random employment.{***}
str_npc8_backstory_c|A month ago, we be goin' back 'ome with a 'old full o' loot, and we stumble on them English, entire fleet o'them. That Antigua 'angman, 'e who'd lost me twice now, 'e be 'appy to buy a rope an' some soap 'imself! But me luck ne'er fails me, an earthquake broke me prison apart, and I run again! All I be needin' now is a resolute capt'n, a brave crew, and a raid or three gone good!{***}
str_npc9_backstory_c|Then I met a troop of brother Cossacks on my way. 'Join us,' they say. 'We're going to fight the Spanish for the French king. He pays well, and the loot is good too.' Why, I agreed. We fought in Spain for a year. When we were about to go back home, we caroused for a bit in the city of Paris. That's when a recruiter pressed me into signing a contract. I awoke on a ship heading to the New World, not a free Cossack any longer, but a mercenary of the French crown. But they missed this one good. As soon as I was on the dry land again, I escaped the froglings. Now I am looking for a way home.{***}
str_npc10_backstory_c|In fact, I could care less about tobacco. I discovered something that will make me one of the richest men in the world. Orchids! These forest flowers are way more beautiful than those bloody tulips. All I need is to find out how to make them grow in pots, then deliver them to Amsterdam... I went for the flowers to the Amazon forests, but local brigands captured me. They offloaded me to the pirates, who delivered me here. Now I sit in this hole waiting for ransom while a business worth millions is stalled!{***}
str_npc11_backstory_c|My life changed the fateful day I accidentally met the daughter of the governor of Barbados. I was smitten. I swore she would become my wife. Thrice did I try to kidnap the girl: from the governor's palace itself, from the ship she travels on, and during a horse ride. But she is guarded too well; I'd need an entire crew to succeed. So I am seeking a party to join for a while.{***}
str_npc12_backstory_c|The Order has many adherents, but lacks enough land in Europe. So, the Grandmaster sent a caravel to the Americas, to seek unclaimed lands and establish a colony of the Order state. At the end of our trip, a storm had struck. The caravel went to the bottom, and I am the only brother to survive it. Now, I have no options than to find some service.{***}

str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well, {Caballero/Senora}, you can lead your people well. You can make a damn fine governor general. Or a viceroy, even.{***}
str_npc4_kingsupport_1|I am sure you would make a fine {king/queen}, Commander.{***}
str_npc5_kingsupport_1|Good, Massa. You do what you want, Juba serve you right and true.{***}
str_npc6_kingsupport_1|You wish to unify the lands and become a high chief? Why, the spirits of the sea and the isles came to me and said they are willing to help. As long as you do not oppress us, the ancient masters of these lands, that is.{***}

str_npc1_kingsupport_2|You'll need the support of other captains to succeed. I'll try talking to those I know. But you'll have to promise offices to everyone who would join us. No matter what sea dogs brag about, each of them secretly sees himself a town governor or a tobacco plantation owner...{***}
str_npc2_kingsupport_2|But no one will fight for the sake of valor alone! Think of what we might offer to our supporters after we win...{***}
str_npc3_kingsupport_2|You'll need more than a wish to conquer an entire colony. You'll need some kind of legitimacy. In Castilia, for instance, only those of purest noble blood receive the highest military offices.{***}
str_npc4_kingsupport_2|We will not succeed alone, though. We must have the colonial nobles recognize your rule. Some might even join you against their lieges, if your offer is convincing - and generous - enough.{***}
str_npc5_kingsupport_2|When you great chief of this land, Massa, make slaves' life better. They die like fleas. No profit!{***}
str_npc6_kingsupport_2|I think all the forest folk and the peoples still residing on the isles will support you.{***}
str_npc7_kingsupport_2|I believe we must return the land to its rightful owners. I mean the natives...{***}

str_npc9_kingsupport_2|As soon as we win, we must lay down an American Sich. Just like Tortuga, but our own. So my Cossack brothers would have a place to gather in and raid enemies!{***}

str_npc3_kingsupport_objection|{Caballero/Senora}! The people you've sent to find supporters act foolishly. We don't have to promise mounds of gold; we must tell about the power of our arms. Otherwise the mission will fail!{***}
str_npc4_kingsupport_objection|Is that true your messengers promise freedom to the slaves? Recall them at once! A ragtag bunch of slaves does not makes an army.

str_npc9_kingsupport_objection|You know what, Ataman? I watched our lads campaign for your sake, for a lack of better word. Look, the folk needs gorilka, salo and a promise of freedom. Yet they rant about fearing God and obeying the pans. You won't get an army that way. You won't invite neighbors for dinner that way, even.{***}
str_npc10_kingsupport_objection|{Meester/Mevrouw}, the people are tired of endless war. They want to hear the promises of peace and free trade. Yet what do your messengers call for?

str_npc11_kingsupport_objection|{Monsieur/Madame}, I have joined you to pursue glory on the battlefield. Yet what do I hear from your messengers? All they prattle about is that you want peace with everyone! Who do they hope to attract that way? Womenfolk and slaves?{***}
str_npc12_kingsupport_objection|Lieutenant, the interests of my Order are diverse and wide. We are used to tolerate many things. But when your messengers keep ranting that 'Freemasons are to blame', or that 'men of God must lock themselves up and keep praying, not run around with pistol and sword' - this I cannot abide by.

str_npc1_personal_mission_report|There you are, Captain! Some pig must have followed me to the spot. My gold is gone! But the illiterate fool missed the most precious part: the map! Old Morgan himself marked on it where the 'Nuestra Seniora de la Concepcion' went down. An entire galleon full of silver and gold, lying off the shore of Hispaniola! We'll have to get wet a bit, but if we raise its treasure, we'll be dirty rich!{***}
str_npc2_personal_mission_report|{Senor/Senora}, I found you at last! The bastard managed to escape my vengeance once more. He begged and groveled and tried to ransom his life with some dirty old map claiming Pizarro marked his treasure cache on it, and when I got distracted, he fled and raised an alarm. I had to retreat, alas. I've kept the map, though, in case you're interested. From the look of it, the place is in New Granada, in the Andes south of Cartagena.{***}
str_npc3_personal_mission_report|It's me again, {Caballero/Senora}! I had some good times with my lads. Won a whole bunch of silver at dice. A funny story that was - Pedro Arriaran, our old sergeant, had lost his last pair of boots and bet some old map out of desperation. Said he'd inherited it from his great grandfather, who had been serving under that loonie Aguirre. It supposedly shows the location of the entrance to an underground passage to Eldorado. Why, I accepted, and naturally won. Don't need it really, so take it, see if you can use it. Who knows, Aguirre had indeed searched for Eldorado until he went all barmy. Sailed up the Orinoco, that's a river down east, Pomeroon is right beside its mouth.{***}
str_npc4_personal_mission_report|Commander! I have great news! I've got a map pointing a way to the royal regalia of Scotland! We should head that way at once! There are other, more mundane treasures buried along with the crown, treasures you will certainly appreciate. The cache is hidden somewhere in the middle of Cuba. We'll have to land in Havana, hire some guides and porters...{***}
str_npc5_personal_mission_report|Massa, I return... Black man colony no more. White man kill and capture all, raze homes and burn fields. But my brothers die well. Kill many white devils. I find skeleton of big white chief in forest. Much gold, nice sword, rusty hoe in belly, hah. I take scroll from corpse. Has map and inscription, you look. White devils sell slaves, must be Dutch. Curacao. I know them well. Too much.{***}
str_npc6_personal_mission_report|I see you. Woe to me, the sacred treasure of my people is gone, the accursed thieves already carried it off over the big water. But by the spirits' will, I overheard a conversation in the palace. Those coyotes spoke of a treasure of the French, who were exiled from their home for revering their spirits in a different way than others. These 'huguenots,' they call them, settled our land with all their treasures, but diseases cut their village down to the last man. The governor has found a scroll telling where to find its ruins. The spirits told me this thief must not possess the treasures of the dead, and so I stole the scroll from the palace. There it is. The spirits say, the village was to the east, on the isles the French have settled ever since.{***}
str_npc7_personal_mission_report|{Master/My Lady}, I spent wonderful time with the native tribe. Their chief is truly a remarkable man, he told me some amazing stories. Some of them might interest you, too. He told me of a people called Maya, far to the west, on the Yucatan peninsula. They are savages now, but some centuries ago theirs was a mighty civilization rivaling the kingdoms of Incas and Aztecs. His tribe are descendants of the Mayan settlers. He told me a legend of the treasures his ancestors hid in their homeland, and even drew a crude map. Maybe we'll visit those lands someday.{***}
str_npc8_personal_mission_report|A 'ook up me ear, {Sonny/Daughter}, I 'ave to say I be glad to see ye. Our Mexico trip didn't go all too well... crappy it went, that is. All in the past now, though. Well, there be that fella on me ship, boastin' 'e knows where the late Flint 'ad buried 'is gold. Be sayin' 'e 'as a map, too. And, well, me and 'im be drinkin' one night, one thing lead to another, and I be stabbin' 'im a bit, and 'e be passin' away. 'ad a map indeed. I can't read the bloody thing though. 'e be babblin' the chest's buried on Bahamas, that's where Nassau is. So, well, take it or somethin'. If ye put it to some use, a share's on ye!{***}
str_npc9_personal_mission_report|Bless you, Ataman! Well, I've met with my mates, feasted on some salo, drank some gorilka, crushed some jaws, and that's enough for now. They told me a funny tale, by the way. Ever heard of our hetman Polubotok, whom the Muscovites thrown into dungeon to rot? Word is, he delivered all his gold to the English bankers for safekeeping first, a whole hundred stones. That's a load of bull, though - in truth, our Cossacks have buried his greatest treasure here on Jamaica, and that's what my mates are looking for. Even drawn a map for me after emptying some bottles. What say you, Ataman, care to visit the hetman's cache?{***}
str_npc10_personal_mission_report|{Meester/Mevrouw}, my luck has turned away again. Not a day had I spent in the jungle when the ague got me. Fortunately, Van Hoorn's old manor was nearby, and they treated me back to my feet there. What, you haven't heard of Van Hoorn? Why, he was among the richest Dutchmen in the New World. They say, he has found a silver mine and developed it in secrecy. Since the day an assassin got him, many have tried to find Van Hoorn's mine, but everyone failed. By the way, while staying at his home, I copied some strange encrypted map I found in a secret locker in his library. Looks a lot like the isthmus of Panama - no wonder, the Spanish dig their silver there, too. Why don't we try our luck?{***}
str_npc11_personal_mission_report|{Monsieur/Madame}, my dreams are crushed by evil fate once again! I reached the very window of my beloved's cabin, but at the sight of me she yelled so loud - out of joy, no doubt - that the entire garrison was there in no time! I felled a twoscore of them, no less, but still had to make my retreat. The next night, I tried again, but the villains had already shipped her out on another vessel in secret! But I found something interesting in the governor's cabin. He has had some dealings with the bloody Spaniards! They buy back the convicted papists from him, the ones the English send to Barbados in chains for a life of hard labor! Hides his gold on their lands, too, somewhere east of Cumana. I stole the map, too. Here it is!{***}
str_npc12_personal_mission_report|I am back as I promised, Lieutenant. Alas, the brethren I have found are not the survivors of my shipwreck, but I was glad to meet them anyway. One of the brothers told me a fascinating story... It appears our wayward comrades, the Knights of the Temple, sought a new home beyound the boundless ocean centuries before us -- and before Columbus, too! Jacques de Molay, the last Grandmaster, personally oversaw the sending of a fleet of five galleys westward, and my brothers here claim one of these reached these shores. I admit I had a hard time believing them, but they gave me a map marking the shipwreck of the Templar galley. It must the shores of Guadeloupe, near Basse Terre...{***}

str_perk_long_descr_57|You've been able to make others follow you since childhood. Wherever you go, you easily find companionship.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_63|You display a good degree of marksmanship - for the kind of firearms you have to suffer, anyway.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_61|As a rank and file crewman of a battery, you've gained some skill at aiming a cannon where it's needed the most.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_60|You've learned the basics of the fine art of buying and selling - and of not going broke in process.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_62|You are pretty good with a knife, they say. You may have a good career as a swordsman ahead of you, if only you don't meet someone better.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_59|Not only you are good at soldiering, you aren't that bad at passing this skill on to others.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_58|You've quickly grasped the basics of life at sea, learning every scrap of knowledge about seamanship you could.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_64|You are good with horses, and that's mutual.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_18|You are skillful not only with sword or musket, but with hammer and grindstone as well. You maintain weapons and armor in top condition.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_02|You can cleave a horse in twain. Along with an armored rider, sometimes.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_21|Among your many talents are some uncommon ones. The meals prepared under your guidance excites everyone in your camp.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_17|You've studied the anatomy of horses, and can perform wonders with sick, lame and wounded animals.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_01|You have learned to drive your sword's tip through a needle's eye. With your eyes closed.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_32|There is nothing worse for a wooden ship than a fire. Having realized that, you have drilled your crew to react instantly to an open flame.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_03|'Strew him whole with flour, and hand me my mace!' That anecdote could have been based on your exploits.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_11|You've learned to find an approach to the most stubborn of horses. Stallions that unhorse the most experienced riders calmly permit you to mount them.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_13|'The dead don't need it anymore.' This motto has become your creed as you strip the baggage and personal belongings of slain enemies for money, food and anything else you can sell on the market.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_16|There is no dirty rag in the world you can't make a decent dress from. The tatters get a second life in your skilled hands.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_33|They say de Graaf captured a sloop with a boat, then a brigantine with a sloop, then a frigate with a brigantine. You, too, can handle any kind of ship the moment you step on its deck.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_23|You approach other people easily. Sometimes it seems you are surrounded by some kind of aura of benevolence, affecting everyone around you.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_14|Your uncanny ability to befriend horses helps you to recover more runaway mounts after a battle.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_45|The soldiers under your command fear no enemy in melee, where they display amazing feats of bravery and strength.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_44|Your musketeers are well-trained, displaying outstanding accuracy and rate of fire.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_34|You've got a perfect sense of the weather and are able to predict the smallest change in wind. A ship under your command gets the most out of every square inch of her sails.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_37|You have had significant success with naval gunnery. The personnel you have trained reload their cannons with astonishing speed.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_26|Your cruelty and utter disregard for morality are infamous across West India. Pirates and outlaws sing the songs about El Diablo and are honored to serve under his - that is, your - command.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_46|The riders of your company charge time and again without fear of death.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_12|Your riding skill allows you to exploit your mount to the maximum of its ability. You ought to try yourself at the races - a prize would be yours in no time.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_24|You are known to be a good Catholic, professing the True Faith and obedient to the Pope. Spanish volunteers are eager to sail under your flag.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_25|You have rejected the papist heresy and the Antichrist that reigns in Rome. Honest Calvinists and Huguenots treat you as a brother and are eager to join your party.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_08|They say Gustavus Adolphus has taught his soldiers to increase their rate of fire by replacing one another in line. You achieve that same rate of fire all by yourself.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_19|You may not look like it, but you can handle the heaviest armor and the most unwieldy tools of slaughter as if they were made of card and paper.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_04|The grim infamy of the professional duelist goes before you. Few would dare to cross their swords with yours.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_20|You have studied the complex science of trading and making a profit out of nothing. ''Buy dear, sell cheap'' - such is certainly not said about you!{***}
str_perk_long_descr_15|You'd strip a corpse of its underwear without flinching if you found it sufficiently pretty or valuable. Wherever you company passes, only naked bodies are left behind.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_54|Sometimes, a doomed ship's captain fancies to play the hero and deprives his enemies of their prize by ordering to scuttle his vessel. Few would dare to do that, were they but aware that their enemy is you!{***}
str_perk_long_descr_27|Whether with a kind word or with a pistol, you make your prisoners offers they can't refuse.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_38|Your intuition and strong sense of danger, combined with your seafaring skills, make you realize in advance when your ship is about to be fired upon and allow you to take measures to minimize the damages.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_05|Your strength, ruthlessness and determination are the stuff of legend. Street bullies and gang leaders try to avoid you like a plague.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_39|You know the Achilles' heel of every vessel. Guided by your steady hand, the bow of your ship crushes enemy broadsides like slivers.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_29|You have secured useful connections in European capitals. Your friends at various courts are willing to assist you with hiring continental troops.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_40|You have learned to compute ranges, angles and trajectories instantly in your mind. The timing of your actions and commands do wonders to the precision of your gunnery.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_48|Your drills and the discipline you have instilled turns your daredevils into mighty and fearless fighters.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_28|The soldiers quickly learn to obey your every word, and not just out of fear of flogging. They know your lessons help them keep their hides whole.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_47|You have drilled your musketeers perfectly and command them well. With you in charge, they display wonders of discipline and precision.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_55|Yarr! Ye be a plague o' high seas an' a nightmare o' them captains. Your fleet drives enemies into a panic, disrupting the well-drilled discipline of their gunners.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_06|Whether you fight with sword or chair leg, few can match your skill at melee. For every enemy thrust you respond with two.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_49|Few adversaries can withstand the crushing charge of your brave cavalry.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_09|Many compare you to William Tell for marksmanship, however few would volunteer for an apple-shot.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_36|You are expert shipbuilder and can ensure that the repair is effective, making your crew fix breaches and sew sails with minimal waste. Moreover, other shipwrights have a hard time swindling you at their shipyards.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_31|The tales of your victories and plunder are told all over the Main, and you have no shortage of daredevils willing to serve under your command.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_41|You know the art of fortification. Even better, you know how to take it apart. Your cannons down stone walls as if they were made of sand.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_56|Your daredevil cutthroats inspire terror in your enemies. Few sailors dare to grab a weapon and join the fight once they hear the Sea Devil himself is boarding their vessel...{***}
str_perk_long_descr_42|A few precise shots at enemy powder magazines, and only burning wrecks remain where your flagship has passed.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_53|Your power and glory make viceroys and governors general tremble. Those whom you ''serve'' dare not to utter a single word in contradiction. But remember, ''The second man in the realm has few friends...''{***}
str_perk_long_descr_51|The strength and bravery of your warriors inspires fear in your adversaries. Enemy soldiers desert in masses whenever they hear that it is your company that marches upon them.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_50|Your musketeers are considered the best trained and most disciplined unit in the entire Caribbean, and rightly so - all thanks to their valorous commander.{***}
str_perk_long_descr_43|The sailors of your fleet don't fear the Sea Devil himself and are ready to follow you all the way to hell and back.{***}

str_comment_intro_female_common_martial|I must say, {dear boy/My Lady} -- do be careful, riding about this dangerous land. If you ever wished to seek a more... em... settled life, I'm sure I could find you a worthy {wife/husband} from among my {warriors/men}.{***}
str_comment_intro_female_common_badtempered|By the way, {boy/girl} -- does your {mistress/husband} know that you nicked {her/his} weapons? I'll wager you're in for a good beating when you get back home!{***}

str_comment_intro_female_common_upstanding|It is not every day that we see a {male/woman} marching for war. Please do not take this amiss, {dear boy/My Lady}, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to become a soldier. I would prefer that {males/women} be untouched by these wars, as I believe the {male/female} to be the custodian of what little gentility and tenderness remains to us.{***}

str_lq_treasures_dialog_desc|Depends... An old friend of mine is a collector of rarities. He has been looking for a certain native artifact, some sort of ancient figurine, for a long time. Recently he uncovered a rumor that it might be stored in a temple complex not far away from here. Local natives keep it hidden in their vault, and worship it in blasphemous idolatric rituals during their annual celebrations.{***}
str_lq_treasures_dialog_1_desc|I need you to steal that figurine. That won't be easy, my sources say these ruins are infested with the savages. Brute force approach won't take you far, you'll have to use your troops to distract the barbarians while you slip by and explore the complex. There are several ruins in there, the figurine must be hidden in one of them, look for chests or something like that. When you see it, grab it and get out of there. Will you do it for me? I'll pay you {reg10} piastres when you return with the figurine.{***}
str_lq_treasures_desc_done|I have stolen the figurine and made it out in one piece. Time to deliver my prize to {s1}.{***}
str_lq_treasures_dialog_done|Oh, splendid! What a wondrous workmanship. You'd never think these brutes are capable of producing such fine works of art, would you? It will look swell in my friend's palace back in Europe, increasing his fame at the court... Here's your {reg10} piastres, they are well-deserved.{***}
str_lq_treasures_dialog_decline|What? Listen up, I've made plans that relied on you doing what you have volunteered to do. You think you can give your word and take it back at your leisure?{***}
str_lq_treasures_menu_desc|You select a group of volunteers and prepare to delve into the ruins. Dozens of tribals, ranging from nearly naked bowmen to regal jaguar warriors, are seen loitering all over the complex.{***}
str_lq_treasures_menu_victory|Clutching the precious figurine, you escape the temple, leaving the incensed natives behind. Who knows what sorcerous curses they are sending your way now? No matter, time to deliver your prize to {s1}.{***}
str_lq_treasures_menu_fail_prison|You fall bleeding, and your men disperse. Taking you for dead, the natives dump your body in nearby river. Some time later, feverish and half-conscious, you are rescued by an unfamiliar group of Europeans. They are no samaritans, though, and quickly put you in chains to sell you into slavery...{***}
str_lq_treasures_menu_fail_escape|You escape the temple, leaving the figurine behind. Innumerable natives are scouring the surrounding jungle now, searching for sacrilegious trespasser. There won't be another opportunity coming...{***}
str_lq_art_party_name|Ambushed battery{***}
str_lq_art_desc|{s2} asked me to assist in defense of artillery battery ambushed near {s3}. Their cannons are undermanned, and a determined enemy attack can overrun their positions any time now.{***}
str_lq_art_dialog_desc|Yes, and promptly! Some soldiers of mine got ambushed while transporting an artillery battery. Some of the gunners fell, and their defenses are about to crumble. I need someone to reinforce their position at once. I'll pay you {reg10} piastres if you get there in time. Can you do that?{***}
str_lq_art_dialog_desc_done|The assault on the battery has been beaten off. I can claim my reward from {s1}.{***}
str_lq_art_dialog_done|I heard the news from my men. Excellent work, {mister/lass}. Our enemies bled themselves dry against that battery, while we hit them where they expected it the least. What a nice day... Ah, I promised you {reg10} piastres. Here, take them.{***}
str_lq_art_dialog_decline|What? Listen up, I've made plans that relied on you doing what you have volunteered to do. You think you can give your word and take it back at your leisure?{***}
str_lq_art_menu_desc|Intense gunfire and an occasional rumble of a demicannon make a dead giveaway that the battery is under assault. You select a group of volunteers and prepare to dash for their position...{***}
str_lq_art_menu_victory|You have fought off the attackers and secured the battery. {s1} will be pleased to hear that.{***}
str_lq_art_menu_victory_prison|You went down after missing one parry too many, but your men and the battery crew have fought off the attackers in the end. {s1} will be pleased to hear that.{***}
str_lq_art_menu_fail_prison|You come to your senses feeling chains on your arms. The battery has been overrun, and the victorious enemy now intends to sell you into slavery.{***}
str_lq_art_menu_fail_escape|You have retreated away from the battery, leaving the surviving gunners to their destiny. {s1} won't be pleased.{***}
str_lq_tribal_party_name|Remote camp{***}
str_lq_tribal_desc|{s2} wants to frame the natives for the coming massacre of an army camp near {s3}. The actual perpetrators of this horrifying act would be me and my men, dressed and armed like savages.{***}
str_lq_tribal_desc_done|The deed was done, I butchered the camp under the guise of a native. Time to claim my reward from {s1}.{***}
str_lq_tribal_dialog_1_desc|You will like it, I am sure. See, I want us to make a decisive move against the godless barbarians still infesting these lands. Problem is, other governors grew complacent and content to leave the savages alone. This will not stand! I am sure if a... eh... gang of natives would brutally massacre an isolated army camp, that would change their attitude. Would you mind taking a part in this little thespian play? I will provide you and your men with barbarian garbs, and will pay you {reg10} piastres after the deed is done. What say you?{***}
str_lq_tribal_dialog_desc|Hmm... Ah. Yes, you do seem to have that savage streak inside... That will do, that will do indeed. Look, I need a discreet mercenary to do some dirty job. And one with good acting skills to boot. How do you think you would look in some native rags?{***}
str_lq_tribal_dialog_done|Ah, yes. Even that Shakespeare fellow couldn't arrange a performance as grand as yours! Even now my colleagues are planning to cut a bloody swath through the jungle, avenging those poor soldiers with fire and sword. Here, a ticket to this play was well worth {reg10} piastres.{***}
str_lq_tribal_dialog_decline|What? Listen up, I've made plans that relied on you doing what you have volunteered to do. You think you can give your word and take it back at your leisure?{***}
str_lq_tribal_menu_desc|You handpick a group of volunteers and prepare for the masquerade. After donning the outfits provided by {s1} and some liberal application of body paint all of you are looking quite savage indeed. Ordering the rest of your men to disperse, you prepare to assault the camp...{***}
str_lq_tribal_menu_victory|The battle is over. The few lucky runaways will carry around the terrible story of bloodthirsty savages emerging from the dark with their bows and stone axes and tattooed faces.{***}
str_lq_tribal_menu_victory_prison|The battle is over. The few lucky runaways will carry around the terrible story of bloodthirsty savages emerging from the dark with their bows and stone axes and tattooed faces.{***}
str_lq_tribal_menu_fail_prison|You collapse from your wounds, watching helplessly as your victims fight like lions, dispersing the pretend natives. Soon they recover your barely breathing body, and opt to sell you into slavery instead of finishing you at the spot. Ironically, they never see through your disguise.{***}

str_lq_fleet_party_name|City{***}
str_lq_fleet_desc|{s2} asked me to set fire at the wharves of {s3}, where a massive fleet construction program is under way. A criminal ringleader at local tavern can take me to the docks, where I am supposed to set every vessel under construction aflame, then flee the place.{***}
str_lq_fleet_p_desc|{s2} wants me to torch the warships being constructed at the docks of {s3}. I am supposed to meet a criminal contact at local tavern, then proceed to the docks and make the whole place burn, preferably without roasting myself.{***}
str_lq_fleet_desc_done|I have burned the docks of {s2} to the ground, turning their shipbuilding effort into a mound of ashes. Time to claim my reward from {s1}...{***}
str_lq_fleet_p_desc_done|I have put the docks of {s2} to the torch; every would-be pirate-hunting vessel is now embers. Time to return to {s1} for my reward...{***}
str_lq_fleet_dialog_1_desc|Good. Then sail to {s1} at once. The underworld of the city does not like the governor much, and they are willing to assist with whatever can potentially topple the bastard. Their man at the tavern will take you to the wharves. Once there, torch every hull on the building berths, and get out of there. I'll pay you {reg10} piastres once his fleet to be is all ashes.{***}
str_lq_fleet_p_dialog_1_desc|That's my {boy/girl}! Sail to {s1} then. Thieves in the city aren't fond of the guv'nor, and agreed to help me. Talk to their man in that watering hole by the docks, he'll lead you in. Then spare no torches setting everything aflame. There's {reg10} piastres in it for ya, and I wanna see the blaze right from here!{***}
str_lq_fleet_dialog_desc|Yes, there is a risky but glorious service you could do to us all... The governor of {s1} has expanded his ship-building program, and if he finishes it, that would strengthen his fleet to unbeatable size. Something has to be done about it... Like, an accidental fire destroying all his progress. Do you think you could pull it off?{***}
str_lq_fleet_p_dialog_desc|Hell yeah, I do. The guv'nor of {s1} is building helluva lot of warships, and I don't like it, not at all. These darn ships ain't making the high seas any safer fer me, if ya get my drift. Think someone is oughta pay him a visit, set the place afire. This is gotta be fun!{***}
str_lq_fleet_dialog_done|Ah, yes. Such a tragic accident, destroying an entire squadron of ships right at the dock, don't you think? Bad luck indeed. By the way, I think you have dropped this bag of piastres...{***}
str_lq_fleet_p_dialog_done|Yeehaw! I hear the fire's taken half the city! They won't be puttin' to sea for months now! You're good, {boy/girl}. Here's yer piastres!{***}

str_lq_fleet_menu_victory|You escape the docks, leaving behind a firestorm fifteen stores high. It will take years to undo the damage you've dealt today. {s1} will be excited to hear the details of your adventure.{***}

str_doughter_quest_1_start|{s0}, the governor of {s4}, sent me a letter requesting a meeting.{***}
str_doughter_quest_1_state_0|{s3} wants me to gain the confidence of {s5} in order to topple his rule from within. He has arranged me to rescue the daughter of {s5} from a mock kidnapping as a start. The staged assault will take place on the streets of {s1} during nighttime.{***}
str_doughter_quest_1_state_1|{s3} invites me for a dinner at the governor's palace in {s1}. I should use this opportunity to become closer with his daughter.{***}
str_doughter_quest_1_state_2|I should meet with the daughter of {s1} again, and use her to blackmail her father into delivering the town to {s3}.{***}
str_doughter_quest_1_state_3|Report back to {s3}.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_4a|You have insomnia? Is something troubling you? Can I help in any way?{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_4b|You are a real gentleman, Master {s2}, but you haven't answered my question.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_5a|Sounds like an affliction of the soul. I ask for your forgiveness; it was not my intention to harrow your feelings. Let us change the subject. On behalf of my father, I would like to express his most sincere gratitude. He is deeply impressed by your chivalry and would like to invite you to dinner, if that is convenient.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_5b|Do you scorn those living in luxury? I get a feeling that you do. Trust me, there are some very rotten people even among the noble. Moreover, we aren't that rich. But my father - he finds you absolutely charming - sends his best regards and an invitation to dine with us.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_7a|Can you feel the fragrance? It's jasmine. People say it helps to forget the past and nurtures dreams for the future. Would you like a blossom?{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_7b|I am sure, a clever and daring person like yourself will succeed in any undertaking.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_7_p_1a|No, thank you. Flowers wither, and I wouldn't keep it anyhow. I try not to burden myself with things nor memories. I have to go now, my lady. Allow me to say once again that I am honored to have met you. Farewell for now.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_first_7_p_1b|You are most kind. You have a generous heart. Unfortunately, I have to go now. Allow me to say once again that I am honored to have met you. Au revoir!{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_4a|True, a governor's daughter has few diversions. Attending church services, handiwork... At times I feel that the city is stifling, but I have nowhere to go and I would never leave my father.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_4b|Alas, Master {s2}, I rarely get a chance to do so. Walking alone in this city can be dangerous. My other pastime, occasionally, is helping Father with his paperwork.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_5a|My father is a rather harsh man. He doesn't trust anyone except me. Don't be deceived by his jolly behavior at the table. When it comes to work, he can be ruthless, even merciless. He's got to rule with an iron fist - otherwise he would not be able to control the entire city.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_5b|I have to confess, I lamented not having a gallant companion, since I do love the dancing, and the strolling, and everything else. But your business here - does it not require your constant attention?{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_5_pa|This is understandable. However, I cannot believe that a cruel man could have brought up a daughter as lovely and gentle as yourself.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_5_pb|For you, I'm willing to put any of my plans on hold. Forgive my candor, but in your presence I feel so alive, as if previously I have only been a fish, lying dormant in ice.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_6a|You shower me with compliments, Master {s2}, but I value sincerity much more than schmoozing.{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_second_6b|A fish? You know, sir, no one has spoken to me like this before. You are an amazing person. You have a sweet yet difficult personality. Please, tell me more about yourself. Where are you from? What do you do? What do you like?{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_third_3a|Do you really think I would accept such a valuable gift with no explanation? How did you afford something so expensive?{***}
str_governers_doughter_quest_doughter_third_3b|Sorry, I cannot accept this. Every time I would open it, I would see greedy hands rummaging through another girl's items... a girl just like me. It's morbid. Please take it back.{***}
str_quest_dinner|After the dinner of several courses, you've got an opportunity to talk to the governor's daughter in private.{***}
str_quest_meet_courier|As you leave the mansion, you spot a stranger discreetly making signs to you.{***}
str_quest_date_doughter|You and the governor's daughter have savored some precious hours together, and ended up walking along the shore with no one else in sight.{***}
str_fleet_presentation_ok|Very well, {sir/m'am}. I am all ears!{***}
str_fleet_presentation_not_ok|{Sir/M'am}, you need to have clerks managing your business in both towns you're thinking of. Not to mention some vessels moored in one of them.{***}

str_suspicious_work_1_mis1|Hm... by the looks of you, I might have a certain task for a {man/woman} of your abilities. One that requires an absence of moral fibre, and quite a bit of discreetness. Interested?{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_mis2|You like tough enough for something I have in mind. A client of mine is looking to expand his business with some old-fashioned hostile takeover of a violent kind, and I am looking for someone to take on the job. You interested?{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_mis3|What do you think about, shall I say, commandeering an unlawfully seized vessel?{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_mis4|How about some good old bodyguard duty?{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_mis5|A job, you say... Tell me, are you good at shooting? I mean man-sized targets.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_mis6|Well, I think I could use your muscles. There is one noble rascal in this town who has made certain very respected people angry. Owes them lots of coin, refuses to pay back. Hired a bunch of cutthroats to guard his arse at all times. He needs to be made an example of.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis1|Not at all, sorry.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis2|Not at all, sorry.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis3|I'd rather not.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis4|It would bore me to tears, so no.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis5|Not good at all, sorry.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_no_mis6|I'd rather not get involved, sorry.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis1|I am all ears, my good man.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis2|Most certainly.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis3|Sure, I could use another one.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis4|Whose body do I need to guard?{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis5|I could hit a squirrel in the eye. Or not, hard to tell from the mess it leaves.{***}
str_suspicious_work_1_p_yes_mis6|What do I have to do? {***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis1|A client of mine, best left unnamed, is involved in a dispute of economic nature with a certain competitor in mining industry. He desires to make a bold statement concerning this competitor's productive enterprise. Specifically, to bomb the bloody thing into smithereens. I've got a right person to plant the powder kegs, but he needs armed escort in the field. I'll pay you {reg10} piastres. Are you up for the job?{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis2|Fine. There is a certain mine that needs to be, shall we say, relieved of staff. When it is done, send a signal to my employer's men to occupy the place. You might have to defend the mine from a counterattack until they arrive, though, so make sure to take a plenty of folks along. Once the new management secures the facility, get back to me, and you are {reg10} piastres richer.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis3|Not for yourself, you silly person. An acquaintance of mine has had his beloved ship seized for card debts. A misunderstanding, really, but one that is taking too much hassle to resolve, and he is longing for high seas. So, I suggested him to seize it back and put to the sea at once. Problem is, the vessel is guarded, and he's got no fighting men to help him carve the way to the deck, just some rabble to man the sails. So, would you help us in this business? I'll pay you {reg10} piastres once the ship is ours and my friend can safely leave the harbor.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis4|A friend of mine is about to visit this town. Last time he passed it, though, he's had some run in with the local thugs. Some scum has tipped them he's coming back, and they are craving for his blood. I fear they'll gut him the moment he steps off his deck. So, I need you to catch up with him at the pier and walk him out of the harbor, while looking like someone the thugs wouldn't want to mess with. Sounds easy, eh? There's {reg10} piastres in it for you once my friend is safely escorted.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis5|There is an affluent individual in this town I want terminated. He always travels around with a crew of bodyguards, and I can't have a luxury of starting an all-out war in the middle of the city, so this gets to be a sniper's job. I've rented a room with a view, and there is a musket there - all you need to do when your mark passes by is not to miss his head. Are you in? I'll pay {reg10} piastres when the job is done.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_mis6|Beat the living crap out of him, that's what! We don't need him dead, he's got to pay us back after all, so a few broken bones and urinating blood for the rest of his life will suffice. His bodyguards won't be as restrained though, you'll have to overcome blades with clubs. Got the balls to do it? I'll pay {reg10} piastres when the job is done.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_p_no_mis1|Nah, sounds too explosive for me.{***}
str_suspicious_work_2_p_no_mis2|I think I'll pass.{***}

str_suspicious_work_2_p_yes_mis6|Consider it done.{***}
str_suspicious_work_3_mis1|Splendid. My man will join you at once. Keep him safe as he sets three bombs at various spots of the mine. When the mine goes kaboom, get back to me for the coin. Just remember to get away from there before the explosion, not that I mind getting a free deal, of course...{***}
str_suspicious_work_3_p_no_mis1|Nah, sounds too explosive for me.{***}
str_suspicious_work_3_p_yes_mis1|We do that.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis1|Ah, yes. I've heard the news. Good job, friend, they won't be mining at this place for months now. Here's your {reg0} piastres, as promised. Pleasure doing business with you.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis2|Excellent work all around. The new management is already profiting from this acquisition. Here's your cut, {reg0} piastres, as promised.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis3|I've got a word from the cap. You did us a big favor. You deserve these {reg0} piastres.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis4|You are quite literally a life-saver, {man/lass}. You bled that gang dry. The only thing my friend's got to fear now is being gored by their boss' branching antlers, e-he-he. Unless lover's pox gets him first. Anyway, I promised you {reg0} piastres, and here they are.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis5|Heh, good shooting, {man/lass}. I've heard his head popped like a watermelon and locals had to wipe his brains off their houses for hours, haha. Here's your coin, {reg0} piastres as we agreed.{***}
str_suspicious_reward_mis6|Yeah, you nailed him good! The bastard will need help wiping himself for the rest of his life. He just crawled in here weeping and paid us everything he owed. Here's your cut, {man/lass}, {reg0} piastres in total.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis1|You hooked up with the sapper and soon reached the mine. He instructs you to cover his back as he plants three powder kegs around the facility. Once the first fuse is lit, you'll be running on limited time.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis2|You were hired to overrun a mine belonging to your employer's competitor. Having done with the guards, you should await for reinforcements to secure the facility, while defending it from a likely counterattack.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis3|You were asked to help a captain to commandeer his vessel that was seized for debts. The ship is marooned in the harbor and guarded well enough to warrant your involvement.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis4|You were hired to pick up a friend of your employer at the deck of his ship and escort him safely out of the harbor. That man had some kind of altercation with the local crime in the past, and your employer fears for his life.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis5|You cautiously slip into the room rented by your employer, and find an arquebus hidden underneath the bed. Your mark is about to pass the street below any moment now, you'll probably only have one opportunity to fire.{***}
str_entance_menu_mis6|You prowl the streets for some time alongside a few other thugs, until you spot your mark loitering outside in the company of his hired blades. Without a word of warning, you charge.{***}

str_mission_result_mis1_succes_captivity2|The bombs go off! With a rumble, the mine collapses, burying the fortunes of its owner and taking you along.

str_mission_result_mis1_fail_4|An explosion rocks the mine, but doesn't cause enough damage to collapse it for good. It does, however, enough damage to you.

str_dock_tutorial|You can leave some of your vessels moored at the dock. If you are heading inland, your fleet will likewise stay moored at the dock, and you'll have to pick up the ships upon your return.

str_messageboard_tutorial|Messageboard stores a list of jobs offered by town and faction authorities. Town jobs are different in each town, while faction-wide jobs are offered in every town belonging to the faction.^^Bands of irregular and colonial soldiers in search of mercenary employment also post their notices on the messageboard.{***}
str_cove_tutorial|Sometimes you may want to make a landing outside nearby towns, which might be controlled by your enemies. The coves allow you to leave your fleet behind and head inland without having to deal with authorities. Upon landing, you can talk to your fleet's quartermaster to moor your vessels and to offload your goods to supply train.{***}
str_smuggling_tutorial|There are rumors smugglers are currently operating from this town. If you want to attempt contacting them and sell your goods without paying taxes, right-click on the town icon and choose the 'Look for smugglers' option.

If this happens, you may try your luck outrunning them or hiding your goods in the hold, but if you fail, a battle is imminent.{***}
str_shipyard_tutorial|The shipyard allows you to purchase, upgrade, repair and sell ships. While managing your vessels, you can change the calibre and amount of cannons deployed on each individual deck, install ship upgrades, hire and upgrade their crews. When buying a new ship, do not forget to restock its ammunition reserves and recruit enough crewmen.{***}
str_tavern_tutorial|The tavern is a center of town's social life.

And if you can't find someone you are looking for, the tavernkeeper will be willing to point you in the right direction.{***}
str_garrison_tutorial|With a city in your possession, you can recruit regular and elite troops of your faction. Availability of troops depends on certain buildings being constructed in the city, and on your rank. Every day the city produces a certain amount of recruits you can hire. To do so, click on the branch of service icon to your left, then click and hold on the trooper you want and choose the amount by moving the slider with your mouse. Icons to your right display the troops already in your company, you can click on their symbols to dismiss the soldiers you don't want to keep.{***}
str_faction_tutorial|When your rank is high enough yet you haven't joined any existing faction, you can conquer a city to rule on your own. You can appoint your hired captains as governors of newly conquered cities, and even convince other nobles to join your growing American kingdom. As a faction leader, you can hire several ministers to help you running your possessions: a treasurer, a drillmaster, a secretary and a sutler.{***}
str_governors_tutorial|You can order your governors to attack enemy troops and cities by right-clicking on their icons and selecting a lord in the list. Similarly, you can right-click on a city of your faction to grant it to one of your nobles to govern. Right-click on the lord himself to order him to follow you around.{***}
str_battleplan_tutorial|At the start of field battle, you can deploy your troops by clicking icons of their branches of service and positioning them where you want your soldiers to take a stand. You can release control over a platoon and let it fight on its own by releasing its icon over the panel at your right. Three buttons above the platoon panel are used to give orders to the entire army - charge enemy, follow you around the battlefield, or hold position.^^Once the battle is joined, you can call up the planning screen with the Battle Map key ('Backspace' by default).{***}
str_townhall_tutorial|When you want to open a business in town, the first thing in order is to hire a clerk to manage your local enterprise. You can find such clerks standing inside town halls. Clerks oversee smooth running of your plantations and manufactories, and you can order them to send convoys carrying goods between any two towns where you have clerks hired, providing you have some free ships moored at the dock of one of these towns. You can also order a clerk to trade goods at any of the towns you have representatives in.^^Another person of interest residing in the town hall is a banker. You can use his services to transfer money to your bank account, where your fortunes will be safe from any mishaps that might happen to you on the road. All business expenses are paid from your bank account rather than your cash reserves.{***}
str_convoy_tutorial|You can order a clerk or your treasurer to send a convoy from any city where you have some ships moored at the dock to any other city, providing you have clerks hired at both. First, select the starting town at the left from among cities with your ships docked inside. Then choose the destination town at the right, and drag the ships you want to assign to the convoy from left panel to the right. On next screen, add the goods you want to transfer. Note that this transaction will be paid from your bank account, and you need sufficient funds in the bank to complete the order.{***}
str_banking_tutorial|Bankers stationed in the town halls can provide you with detailed information on your expenses. You can use this screen to transfer funds to your bank account, where they are used to pay for your business expenditures.

str_town_tutorial|Cities in the Caribbean serve as hubs of trading and commerce. You can click on various buildings to access their features - go to the shipyard to buy, sell and upgrade vessels, browse the market for arms and armor, check the tavern to rest and encounter interesting strangers, visit the mansion to meet up with the town's governor and the town hall to hire a clerk to represent your business interests in the city. Some buildings can only be accessed when you are the governor of the town. Additional functions such as construction, bulk trading and messageboard can be accessed with the column of buttons in the upper left corner.{***}
str_construction_tutorial|Having reached the business reputation of a Shopkeeper, you can begin constructing productive enterprises within towns after hiring a clerk to represent your local interests. At first you are limited to resource harvesting facilities, but with further reputation advancement you can access manufactories producing finished goods. Raw resources are harvested from the countryside around the town, and each city only has access to a limited selection of resources. Manufactories on the other hand can be constructed anywhere, but they require a constant supply of specific resources to run.^^When you gain governorship over a city, you can also construct municipal buildings.^^The buildings already constructed in town are displayed as a list of round icons at the top.{***}
str_trading_tutorial|You can use this screen to purchase the goods produced locally, or sell the contents of your cargo hold. Goods readily available in town tend to fetch a low price, while those in high demand sell at a premium. You can click on the 'Merchant' and 'Your fleet' tabs to switch either panel to display your supply train for heading inland, or your warehouse storing goods locally (the warehouse becomes available once you have hired a clerk).^^Click and hold on the goods icons and drag the slider left or right with your mouse in order to move the goods between panels, then click on the 'Done' button to confirm transfer.{***}
str_warehouse_tutorial|Having hired a clerk in town, you gain a warehouse to store production of your local enterprises, along with any goods you want to leave in town, such as resources needed by your manufactories. If you don't have a warehouse in a city, ships moored at the dock can serve you as temporary storage space, but their cargo capacity is limited.{***}

str_slavery_tutorial|You were sold into slavery!^^When you lose a battle, enemies take you prisoner, rob you of all possessions, then sell you into slavery at a mine or plantation nearby. You can try escaping from your confinement alone, but your best bet is to talk other prisoners into starting an uprising and breaking out together.{***}
str_navalsiege_tutorial|When you choose to attack a city from the sea, up to 3 larger warships in your fleet will join the offensive. You begin the battle aboard your flagship at the roadstead outside the firing range of cannons. Having selected one of your vessels, you can order it to advance and bombard the coastal fort, or fall back to the roadstead if it ends up damaged by return fire. While you are aboard, you can man one of the cannons to bombard the city. Once the fortifications are breached, you can order your soldiers to make a landing on boats on their own, or join them in the assault.{***}
str_siege_tutorial|When you choose to attack a city on land, your party spends several hours constructing siege ladders. Once the preparations are over, you are deployed a short distance from the fort. You can order your troops to attack, hold position or follow you around. Your objective is to reach the ladders, scale the fortifications and defeat the defenders, all while being bombarded from the walls. Alternately, if you own some artillery pieces, you can try bombarding the fort yourself and make some breaches to ease the assault.{***}
str_gambling_tutorial|The game of choice in the Caribbean taverns is a Blackjack variant. Both players strive to reach a score closest to 21 points without going bust. An ace is worth 11 points and face cards are worth 10. Upon dealing your first two cards, you have an option to hit (take another card) or stand (keep your hand). Whoever ends up with more points without going over 21, wins the pot. In case of push (draw) both players keep their coins.^^While dealing, you can attempt to rig your hand and deal yourself better cards. Your ability to do so unnoticed depends on your Gambling skill. If your attempt at cheating is spotted, the entire tavern will rise against you in a huge brawl.{***}
str_repair_tutorial|Some of your ships are heavily damaged. You can restore some of the damage by using the 'Repair' button on the party screen, but repairs consume resources - timber is used to patch the hull and linen is needed to fix the sails. Your Engineer skill affects the maximum percentage of hull and rigging you can restore in the field - if it's not developed enough, repairs in the shipyard are your only way to restore your ship to pristine condition. Some ship upgrades help your crewmen fix their vessels while at sea, but that takes a plenty of time.{***}
str_supplytrain_tutorial|When you head ashore from a city or a cove, your ships are left on the moor and supply train is formed. You can reload goods and supplies from your fleet by switching tabs in the 'Bulk Trading' mode (or 'Warehouse' mode, if you have a clerk in town) before leaving a city, or by talking to your quartermaster about managing goods when landing in a cove. The capacity of supply train depends on your Inventory Management skill.^^When you return to a point of landing and prepare to put to sea, your supply train is dismantled and the goods within are automatically reloaded to your ships. While in a city, any excess goods from the train that your fleet cannot accomodate will be sold on the market, unless you have a warehouse or additional ships still moored in the harbor to store them. In a cove, excess goods will be lost!{***}
str_prisoner_tutorial|You have captured some prisoners!^^Colonial plantations and mines are always in a dire need of hands capable of hard physical labor. They are supposedly staffed with convicted criminals, native peasants and african slaves, but in truth plantation owners aren't particularly discriminating when it comes to employment of new workers, and you can always sell them your prisoners of war. If you don't feel like heading inland, you can look around the harbor taverns and offload your captives to a slave trader, but these enterpreneurs are much more stingy with their money.^^While at sea, the amount of captives you can take along is defined by your fleet's cargo capacity, with a bonus from your Prisoner Management skill. On land, however, only Prisoner Management matters, which often means significantly lower value. Take care making a landing with a large band of prisoners, then - once taken out of your cargo hold and into the open, they'll use every opportunity to escape.{***}

With great many apologies, you are released from captivity, and the regretful administrator provides you with some money and equipment to help you on the road.{***}
str_mine_release_2|One of the guards orders you to follow him to the office of administrator. When you arrive, the facility's manager offers you a glass of wine and apologizes for mistreatment.
