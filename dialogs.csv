dlga_camp03jorge01:camp03jorge01_|Ha-ha, that's true, senor. Dark indeed. You are new in {s2}, are you not?{***}
dlga_camp03jorge01_:camp03jorge02|Never been here before. And I hope I'll never have to suffer the local hospitality again.{***}
dlga_camp03jorge02:camp03jorge02_|That will be arranged, {senor/senora}... You'll never see this city again, nor any other for that matter. You see, friend, this eve is going be a last for you either.{***}
dlga_camp03jorge02_:camp03jorge03|Wha...?{***}
dlga_camp03jorge03:camp03jorge03_|Si, senor. An execution is scheduled at dawn. I have a long history of crossing the Crown; as for you, you are going to be charged with piracy and espionage. Unless, of course, we make a prison break.{***}
dlga_camp03jorge03_:camp03jorge04|Prison break? How?{***}
dlga_camp03jorge04:camp03jorge04_|Easily enough. We'll kill the wardens. The guards outside the prison have been bribed and are already carousing in a tavern nearby. The doors to our cells are unlocked, my sword is here with me, and you'll find a cutlass slipped in by the sergeant's men. So are you with me, senor?{***}
dlga_camp03jorge04_:close_window|Hold on, the guards were bribed? And there is a cutlass indeed... Were you sitting here waiting for me all along? This looks a bit staged... Whatever, let's discuss it once we make it out.{***}
dlga_camp03jorge02_:camp03jorge05|You seem very unperturbed for a man on a death row. By the way, my name is...{***}
dlga_camp03jorge05:camp03jorge05_|I don't need your name, senor. I know enough about you. As for my name, it's Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Acevedo. Don't bother trying to memorize it, Jorge is just fine. By the way, care to make it out of here?{***}
dlga_camp03jorge05_:camp03jorge04|Gladly. How do you plan to walk out?{***}
dlga_start:camp04jorge00_|You are pretty good with that cutlass, senor.^^By the way, I have a business proposal for you. Would you mind joining a certain endeavor?{***}
dlga_camp04jorge00_:camp04jorge01|I might be. What's the catch?{***}
dlga_camp04jorge01:camp04jorge02|I know you have encountered a certain Francois shortly before ending up in that dank hole where we have met. Did he mention a sobriquet he goes by in these parts?{***}
dlga_camp04jorge02:camp04jorge03|Francois the Legalist, that's how he's called. A man of great intellect and many mysteries. It would do good for you not to associate with the likes of him, senor. My proposal will be of a different nature than his.{***}
dlga_camp04jorge03:camp04jorge03_|The 'treasure' he rambles on about is merely a myth dwelling within that smartass head of his. Me, I speak of values no king could dream of claiming. And also about a voucher for a schooner waiting on the wharves of Petit Goave. Still eager to know more?{***}
dlga_camp04jorge03_:camp04jorge04|Free ship? Dear senor, I can only surmise you must be too rich to pursue treasures.{***}
dlga_camp04jorge04:camp04jorge04_|Oh, I suspect one schooner won't make it, we'd need an entire fleet. The treasure I speak of is of a special sort, no vulgar caches of old Flint or whatever the town loonies are babbling about. So what is your answer, senor?{***}
dlga_camp04jorge04_:camp04jorge04a1|Riveting tale, my friend...{***}
dlga_camp04jorge04a1:camp04jorge05|Riveting tale, my friend. But shouldn't we find a better place to discuss the details? Mind you, we are standing knee deep in the bodies of wardens, and their comrades might not end up as corrupt as we like to believe.{***}
dlga_camp04jorge04_:camp04jorge04b1|Apologies, old man, but the answer is no...{***}
dlga_camp04jorge04b1:camp04jorge05|Apologies, old man, but the answer is no. I arrived in the Caribbean to live a life of my own, not to perform in badly designed stage plays. And dangerous ones to boot.{***}
dlga_camp04jorge05:close_window|So be it. For now let us leave this sordid place. An assistant of mine is waiting outside, he will escort us out of this city.{***}
dlga_camp04jorge03_:camp04jorge03b1|I am afraid I'll have to reject your gracious proposal...{***}
dlga_camp04jorge03b1:camp04jorge05|I am afraid I'll have to reject your gracious proposal. This conversation was every bit as exciting as triumphing over six adversaries together, but I have this nagging feeling that there is something weird and unnatural about you. I came to the New World looking for different sensations and different companions, sorry.{***}
dlga_start:camp05jorge00_|Senor, you seem pale. It appears you have missed a sword thrust or three, are you all right?{***}
dlga_camp05jorge00_:camp05jorge01|Just a flesh wound. What happened?{***}
dlga_camp05jorge01:camp04jorge00_|We are still in the prison, but I cleared the way. Your assistance wasn't exactly helpful, but you sure look cute with a blade.^^By the way, I have a business proposal for you. Would you mind joining a certain endeavor?{***}

dlga_start:camp10mac01|Good. Now, {mister/lady} {playername}, you'll have to lead this party to victory. I am too old and too frail to run around with a broadsword under musket fire. You need to deploy the soldiers first. Placing pikemen and swordsmen at the forefront and keeping the musketeers behind them is a most prudent idea.{***}
dlga_start:camp11mac00_|Nice battle, sir. Kinda reminds me of Robert the Bruce's battle against the English.^^(Jesus, mister McGonagall is going to read some of his poetry again...){***}
dlga_start:camp12mac00_|Wake up, my friend. We are prepared to disembark, but rest assured, it won't be an easy walk. The villains holed up inside an old fort, and they may possess a cannon. So, ashore you go!{***}
dlga_start:camp13mac00_|I watched you from the quarterdeck, my friend, and I swear you have fought like William Wallace at Falkirk! I doubt there is anything about the art of war that I could teach you further...{***}

dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Is there a change of plans?{***}
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_3:lord_prison_break_confirm_4|Keep behind me and try to stay out of the fighting. I'll break us through.{***}

dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_3:lord_prison_break_confirm_4.1|Weak or not, I'll need you to grab a weapon and help me fighting.{***}
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_3:close_window|Actually, don't get involved in this.{***}

dlga_lord_prison_break:lord_prison_break_confirm|I've come to get you out of here{***}
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm:lord_prison_break_confirm_2|Thank the Lord! It is awful in this dungeon.{***}
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_2:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|But how will we escape? The garrison will attack us the moment we walk outside. I could help you fighting them, but after the days in this rotten cell I am weak as a kitten...{***}
dlga_lord_prison_break:close_window|Nevermind -- just stay quiet.{***}
dlga_start:drunk_response|What are you staring at?{***}
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|Whoa, I've never met talking horse dung before!{***}
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|You'll be suffering a world of pain!{***}

dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Why, you were looking for a fight, and you have found one!{***}
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|Thought so. Remove yourself from my presence, at once.{***}

dlga_start:dialog_fights_organizer_q1|Good day, {mate/lass}. I suppose you are not someone to shy away from a good fighting. Care to make yourself some silverentertaining the local ne'er-do-wells? Or maybe you are one of those who prefer to watch?{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q1:dialog_fights_organizer_q2|Possibly. It takes what exactly?{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q2:dialog_fights_organizer_q2|I am setting up some fights in a cozy little place tonight. They are, uh, not totally legal, but the powers that be oftenlook the other way, if you know what I mean. If you participate, you may walk out a rich {man/woman}.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q2:dialog_fights_organizer_q4|Tell me more?{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q4:dialog_fights_organizer_q4|There rules are simple enough. There are several kinds of fights - combat between groups, every man for himself, and a timedbattle of a group of seasoned warriors against a horde of aspiring rabble. You can select any fight you wish, but thespectators don't like seeing the same faces all the time, so you'd have to settle with only one. The participants bring theirown equipment, any armor and even horses are permitted, whatever you wish. But weapons are not, we don't need any manslaughterhere, you'll get to use a practice weapon drawn by lots. Naturally, you can place a bet on your victory. And some are known tobet on a victory of another, but few lived to tell the tale if the word gets out...{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q4:dialog_fights_organizer_q6|I want to fight in a ground against other groups.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q6:dialog_fights_organizer_q6|Very well. We'll have 64 participants distributed across the teams of equal size. Every round,a half of them that loses is kicked out. If you endure it until the finals and defeat the finalopponent, you'll make a thousand piastres, not to mention the glory among men and the adorationof women! Decide swiftly, we are about to begin. You only have several minutes to prepare yourequipment and place your bets.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q6:dialog_fights_organizer_betting|Let's do this.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_betting:close_window|Let's betting and good luck !{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q6:dialog_fights_organizer_q7|Hm, tell me about every man for himself, rather.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q7:dialog_fights_organizer_q7|It's as simple as it gets. Several men enter the field, one leaves. The best combatants move tonext round, until two are left. The winner gets it all, glory, reputation, silver. A thousand ofpiastres is at the stake, mind you! If you agree, I'll give you several minutes to prepare yourequipment and place your bets.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q7:dialog_fights_organizer_betting|Let's do this.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q7:dialog_fights_organizer_q6|Actually, group fights sound more appealing.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q6:dialog_fights_organizer_q8|How about standing against the rabble, what's the conditions?{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q8:dialog_fights_organizer_q8|Feel yourself a Hercules, eh? Fine enough for me. There will be only six of you, and tentimes as many enemies. Not all at once, of course, they'll be sent in in waves. Your goalis to hold it out for 60 seconds. If you're still fighting a minute after it begins, youare among the winners. The prize is five thousands piastres, shared among all your teammembers still standing upright. If you agree, I'll give you several minutes to prepareyour equipment and place your bets.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q8:dialog_fights_organizer_betting|Let's do this.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q8:dialog_fights_organizer_q6|Actually, group fights sound more appealing.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q6:dialog_fights_organizer_q9|Bringing down 'heroes' sounds more exciting, frankly...{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q9:dialog_fights_organizer_q9|Believer of strength in numbers, I see... There will be only six enemies, and ten timesas many of you, sent in wave after wave. I think I'll assign you to the first group...Your goal is to fell all six enemies in a span of a minute. If they are all down 60seconds into the fight, your gang wins. The prize is five thousands piastres, sharedamong all your team members still capable of fighting. If you agree, I'll give youseveral minutes to prepare your equipment and place your bets.{***}

dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q10:dialog_fights_organizer_q10|Well... Actually, I do have something that might interest you, then. But hush, not a wordto anyone. Some fighters are bloodthirsty just like you. And some spectators, too. And Iam here to please... So, well, we have some real fights too, in underground fighting pits.With real weapons, any you can bring. Interested now?{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q10:dialog_fights_organizer_q12|Indeed. Tell me more.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q12:dialog_fights_organizer_q12|There is only one rule - no rules. The participants can fight using anything they bring along,even muskets and claymores. The groups are selected by drawing lots - if you are lucky, youmay end up being four against one. If you aren't, you might end up this one. The survivorsproceed to next round, until one remains. The deadmeat goes to sleep with the fishes, and so dothe cripples if there is no one to take care of them. The conditions are crap, I know, and youwon't have much glory either - few know of these fights, and even fewer approve them. But theprize is worth it, five thousands piastres all for one man! And the bets are higher, too. So,are you ready? Then let's go and prepare your stuff.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q12:dialog_fights_organizer_betting|Let's do this.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q12:dialog_fights_organizer_q4|Sounds too dangerous. Let's get back to the fights I wouldn't get convicted for.{***}

dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q4:dialog_fights_organizer_q5|Come to think of it, I'd rather stay a spectator.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q5:dialog_fights_organizer_q5|The entrance fee costs a hundred piastres.

They are, uh, not totallylegal, but the powers that be often look the other way, if you know what I mean. Some good fighters will be battling there,that would be a sight to remember.

dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q14:dialog_fights_organizer_q4|Fight. Remind me the rules.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q14:dialog_fights_organizer_q5|To watch is enough. Tell me more.{***}
dlga_dialog_fights_organizer_q14:close_window|No, I didn't change my mind. Bye.{***}
dlga_start:fistfight_response|You look like a {fellow/lady} who can take some beating -- and deal some as well. Care to hear my proposal?{***}
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|I am listening.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Good -- I'm glad you're interested. Here's the plan... It's a little complicated, so listen well.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|You and this other fellow will start up a fight here. No weapons, no armor -- I'll sit back and take bets, and split the profits with the winner. If we make a loss, then I'll cover it. You've got nothing to lose -- except a bit of blood, of course.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a piastre or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|So, as you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, and people bet against you -- and then come back fast, and win, before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor, and then jump back off your feet and take the other guy down. However, you have to win in the end in order for me, and you, to make money.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Also, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix. So, one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|And one other thing -- my mate, your opponent, he doesn't take too well to complexity. So he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|So, what do you think?{***}
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|I have better things to do.{***}
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Good day, {mister/lady}.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|And to you as well. Are you a merchant, perchance?{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A merchant I am, indeed.But my wares are not like the rest. They need food, and some roof above their heads, or they lose their value quickly.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Livestock?{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Almost. My kind of livestock ensures the sugar cane plantations stay thriving and productive.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Slaves, then.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Exactly. The lands around this city need a plenty of working hands. The plantation owners pay me well for every pair of capable hands.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Criminals, prisoners of war, shipments from overseas, that kind of thing mostly.Still, once in a while I deal with... private contractors, as well.You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, by any chance?{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Why me?{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|And why not? In this here land, sooner or later you'll came by someone intent on taking your head off your shoulders. And, God willing, you'll be the one left standing when the dust clears.Why not make some extra gold while you're at that? Take your enemies captive, deliver them to me, and I'll pay you fifty piastres for each head.And I am not asking any questions about who they are and where they come from.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it!There's a lot of silver to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.{***}
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Nevermind.{***}
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.{***}
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, James. Care to take a look?{***}
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...{***}
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.{***}
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all the prisoners I have with me.{***}
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all:ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2|I'll take your {reg0} {reg2?prisoners:prisoner} off your hands for {reg1} piastres. Deal?{***}
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Certainly.{***}
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_all_2:ramun_pre_talk|I'll think about it.{***}
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?{***}
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody captive?{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms.If you want to capture someone alive, you should knock them in the head with something blunt. Like a club or a musket butt. A fist will do, too, as long as they aren't bleeding dry from a sword or bullet wound.You have a blunt weapon with you, don't you?{***}
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.{***}
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is bash them down with your weapon, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons.It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use,but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise,but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not always that simple. Blunt weapons tend to do little damage, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly.And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword.Moreover, having to drag prisoners around will slow you down, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done.It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Another thing. Managing prisoners is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself.If you want to capture a lot of them, you should try and learn the tricks of the trade,or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.{***}
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.{***}
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away.It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving.Here, have it.{***}
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, James. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.{***}
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. If you want to capture someone alive, you should knock them in the head with something blunt. Like a club or a musket butt. A fist will do, too, as long as they aren't bleeding dry from a sword or bullet wound.It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use,but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.{***}
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?{***}
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.{***}
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.{***}

dlga_bandit_leader_1a:bandit_leader_1b|Very well, you will live. But first, I need information. Your gang have kidnapped the nephew of a merchant in town. Tell me where you're hiding him, and you may go in peace -- providing you never cross my path again.{***}
dlga_bandit_leader_1b:close_window|Oh bless you, {sir/my lady}. Bless you. We've done the lad no harm. We've been keeping him in our hideout near {s9}. I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking it...{***}

That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although Heaven knows he won't be the last.... Anyway, maybe you can help me with something. Let's talk more inside. Out here, we don't know who's listening.{***}
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendid work. You have hired enough men to take on the bandits. Now -- travellers entering {s9} have told us that there is a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town. I suspect that they are all from the same band, the one that took my nephew. Hunt them down and defeat them, and make them disclose the location of their lair!{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Very well. I shall hunt for bandits.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Why don't you come with us?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I have just as much chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.{***}
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my nephew? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {man/woman} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|Very well. I go now to attack the bandits in their lair, and find your nephew.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.{***}
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My nephew is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university back in Europe. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well-earned.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|The money is most welcome, and I am glad to have been of service{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Good! Now... Are you interested in making some more?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Possibly. What do you need?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in these lands, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there's are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a {s0}'s eye wanders far from {reg4?her:his} domain, and {reg4?her:his} subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle -- and I can't think of anyone better than you. So, what do you say?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|How do I know that you're telling me the truth?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 piastres, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right. I'll lead your men.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Yes. Give them the sign.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Good! Now -- strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them. May the heavens be with you!{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Not now. I will need to rest before I can fight again.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I shall have to finish this affair without you, but I would be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|I'm sorry. This is too much, too fast. I need time to think.{***}
dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion|You may do as you wish, {sir/my lady}, but I am disappointed. You would do well to reconsider. I am a rich {reg65?woman:man}, and would show you my gratitude in coin.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_3:merchant_quest_1a|So here's my proposition. You look like you've had a bit of experience with a blade -- and more importantly, you must have a bit of fire in your belly, or you wouldn't be coming here to seek your fortune. So here's what I'm asking you to do: gather a small party, track down these bandits to their lair, teach them a lesson they won't forget, and get my nephew back safe. In return, you'll earn my lasting gratitude and a bit of silver. What do you say?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:merchant_quest_1b|I am interested.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1b:merchant_quest_1c|You won't be able to do this by yourself, though. If you try and take on the whole gang singlehandedly, the hunter will become the hunted, I'll warrant. You'll first want to round up a group of volunteers. There's always a few lads in the villages around here, looking for a bit of work that's more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water. They'll follow you if you pay. So... Take this purse of 100 piastres. Consider it an advance on your reward. Go round to the villages, and use the money to hire some help. I'll reckon that you need at least five men to take on these bandits.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1c:merchant_quest_1d|Very good, sir. I'll go collect some men from around the villages.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1d:close_window|Good. You can find me again in the tavern here in {s1} after you've got your group together. Then we'll speak about what we do next.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:close_window|I am not interested, have more important business to do.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_2|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Now -- go find and defeat that group of bandits.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now -- go attack that bandit hideout, get my nephew back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_4b8|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:close_window|As I say, I have more important business elsewhere.{***}
dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in {reg4?her:him} to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, {reg4?she:he}'s grateful enough that I got rid of {reg4?her:his} crooked captain -- a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army, if the price is right -- but {reg4?she:he} can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of {reg4?her:his} failure to take care of things {reg4?herself:himself}.{***}
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|That hardly seems fair...{***}
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? Rulers do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. {reg4?She:He} didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as governors go -- but {reg4?she:he}'s a weak ruler, as they all are here, and weak rulers must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same, in {reg4?her:his} shoes.{***}
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair in {s5}'s face -- but {reg4?she:he}'s taken note of you, and decided that you're not worth hanging, and that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day of the week. {reg4?She:He} might even have work for you, further down the road. Or, you can sell your {s0} to one of {reg4?her:his} competitors. Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste. Good luck.{***}
dlga_merchant_quests_last_word:close_window|I am preparing to leave town in a short while. It's been an honor to know you. Good luck.{***}

I do not require you to stay close by, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would serve us better away from our camp.

dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window.1|I have changed my mind -- you are free to go.{***}
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, {sir/madame}, to hold a {reg65?lady:free-spirited lad} like this...{***}
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.{***}
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.3|Why haven't my family paid my ransom? You may hold me as prisoner, but it seems that you care for me more than they do!{***}
dlga_lady_stranded_next:close_window|Greetings, {s0}. The tides of war have left me stranded here in this fortress, but I will shortly be departing.{***}

dlga_lady_talk_refugee:lady_captive_talk|You assume wrong, {reg65?my lady:sirrah}!{***}
dlga_lady_captive_talk:lady_captive_confirm|What?! What infamy is this?{***}
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window|My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave.{***}
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window.1|Contact your family to arrange for a ransom, my lady.{***}
dlga_start:close_window.20|We will shortly depart{s5}. It is good to know that some people in this world retain a sense of honor.{***}
dlga_start:close_window.21|Well, {playername} -- you fought a duel with {s10}, and lost. According to our custom and tradition, I should no longer receive you. Farewell, {playername}.{***}
dlga_start:lady_duel_lost|Oh {playername} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought {reg3?her:him}, for our honor and tradition demand that, having lost to {reg3?her:him}, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {playername}.{***}

dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that {reg3?woman:man}'s attentions!{***}

dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.{***}
dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide {reg0?her:him}. I fear {reg0?she:he} has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.{***}

dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.4|What brings you here today?{***}
dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, {reg3?she:he} was not worthy of my affections.{***}
dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that {men/people} should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.{***}
dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honor now demands that {reg0?she:he} and I no longer meet... I was fond of {reg0?her:him}, you know. You did me no service by fighting {reg0?her:him}, {sir/madame}.{***}
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson.I hope {reg3?she:he} never forgets {reg3?her:his} humiliation.I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.{***}

dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}.It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.{***}

dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried.The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour.That alone will convince many of my innocence.{***}
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude.I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.{***}
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.{***}

dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {lord/lady}.I have always served the governors of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on.Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {lord/lady} of this place.Now, do you intend to keep me on as the seneschal? I promise you will not be disappointed.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence,may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the city?{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another noble.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}.I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now,if at any time you find you have further need of me,I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the fortress to your forces.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to keep it for myself.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions,you can do one of several things.First, you could station a garrison here to protect the city from any immediate counterattacks,then request an audience with some wealthy noble and ask him to make you an offer.It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me.If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege and protector who would accept homage from you.Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the city.Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}.However, no noble in the land will recognize your claim to the city unless it is verified by royal decree.They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity.Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.{***}
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.{***}

dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?{***}
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {sire/woman}.For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the storerooms of the fortress,I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison...All mundane matters on this settlement are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord.Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves.{***}

dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_1:troublesome_bandits_intro_2|As a matter of fact, I could say the same.A merchant in {s1} offered me some nice coin for your heads.{***}
dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_2:close_window|A bounty hunter! Kill {him/her}! Kill {him/her} now!{***}
dlga_start:deserter_paid_talk|What do you want again? You've got more money to hand us, or something?{***}
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2a|Sorry to trouble you, I'll be on my way now.{***}
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2a:close_window|Good. Now go and get rich.I want to see that purse of yours full the next time we meet.{***}
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2b|No way. Now it's your turn to pay.{***}
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2b:close_window|What? You want trouble with us? Now you got it!{***}
dlga_start:deserter_talk|No more serving fancy lords. From now on, we will only fight for ourselves. You better hand us your gold now, or we'll see what colour your entrails are.{***}
dlga_deserter_talk:close_window|You shouldn't have deserted your army. That was the last mistake of your sorry life.{***}
dlga_deserter_talk:deserter_barter|All right, all right. Don't hurt me, I am ready to pay!{***}
dlga_deserter_barter:deserter_barter_2|Wise move. Now, having a look at your baggage, I reckon a fellow like you could easily afford {reg5} piastres for free passage. Pay us, and then you can go.{***}
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3a|Fine, here's your {reg5} piastres.{***}
dlga_deserter_barter_3a:close_window|Heh. That was easy, now, was it? All right. Get out of my sight.{***}
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3b|I don't have that much money with me.{***}
dlga_deserter_barter_3b:close_window|Too bad. Then we'll make it by selling you to plantations.{***}
dlga_start:clerk_ask|Good day, {sir/madame}. Can I help you?{***}
dlga_clerk_ask:clerk1|I am looking to start a business in this city.{***}
dlga_clerk1:clerk1_p|Splendid idea, {sir/m'am}! Yet you don't look like a right kind of person to sit in the office doing accounting for months on end, am I right? And a successful enterprise needs to be supervised on a hourly basis, oh yes.{***}
dlga_clerk1_p:clerk2|So what do you suggest?{***}
dlga_clerk1_p:close_window|Nevermind then.{***}
dlga_clerk2:clerk2_p|I just happen to be looking for work in the management, as a matter of fact. Being a mayor's scribe gets dull over the years. Tell you what, sign me up as your local supervisor, and your business here will run like well-oiled cogwheels!{***}
dlga_clerk2_p:clerk3|And why would I want to do that?{***}
dlga_clerk2_p:close_window|Some other time maybe.{***}
dlga_clerk3:clerk3_p|Why, I can read and write, and count beyond my fingers, all rare and precious talents in this backwater. And I know the ins and outs of this city like no other. Simply put, you won't find a better man to fill these shoes, I can vouch for that. For 50 piastres a day, I will keep a good eye over your farms or manufactories, manage accounts and inventory, and, if necessary, keep stocking raw resources or sell our output on the market. You simply can't run a business from far away without a person like me.{***}
dlga_clerk3_p:close_window|Very well, you've got your job.{***}
dlga_clerk3_p:close_window.1|Some other time maybe.{***}
dlga_clerk_ask:fire_clerk1|Your services are no longer required.{***}
dlga_fire_clerk1:fire_clerk1_p|I... see. May I ask you to reconsider? Without me to supervise your business, you'll have to close down your enterprises and sell away the remnants of the stock that wouldn't fit your cargo hold. And the price won't be pretty.{***}
dlga_fire_clerk1_p:close_window|I am aware of it. Give all the necessary instructions on your way out.{***}
dlga_fire_clerk1_p:close_window.1|Hm, you may be right. Very well, keep up your work.{***}
dlga_clerk_ask:clerk_fleet_1|I need you to organize a convoy to ship goods between my facilities.{***}

dlga_clerk_ask:close_window|I want to trade some goods at one of my offices.{***}
dlga_clerk_ask:close_window.1|Just passing by.{***}
dlga_start:tavernkeeper_talk|Good day, {sir/madame}. What can I help you with?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine|I was asked to bring you {reg9} units of {s4}.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Finally! I had almost nothing left.I provided the payment for the {s4} in advance.Take these {reg5} piastres. That should cover your troubles.And give {s9} my regards.I'll put in a good word for you next time I deal with him.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_pretalk:tavernkeeper_talk|Anything else?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete|I was asked to bring you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost some of the cargo on the way.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete:tavernkeeper_pretalk|A robber ambush, eh?You are lucky you escaped with your head still attached to your shoulders.Anyway, I can't pay you more than {reg5} piastres for this.And I will mention it to {s1} that my order was delivered incomplete,so you will have some stuff to explain to him.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost|I was asked to bring you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost the entire shipment on my way.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|You what? I was waiting for that {s4} for weeks!And now you are telling me that you lost it?Rest assured, I will let {s1} know about this.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks|I'd like to buy every man who drops by this tavern tonight a mug of your best {s0}.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2|You are most generous, {my lord/my lady}. I reckon {reg5} piastres should cover the cost. What should I tell the lads?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Let everyone know of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Not a word more, {s0}. Tonight, your name will be cheered by everyone in my tavern.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|On a second thought, cancel that order.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_job_ask|I am looking for a job. Have you heard of anyone who might need the services of a {man/woman} like myself?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_ask:tavernkeeper_job_search|Hmm... Well, {s10} is always willing to hire mercenaries to fight in {reg0?her:his} wars.{s9}{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_search:tavernkeeper_job_result|Let me think some more...{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_search|I have heard that {s7} {s9}{s10} You may want to speak with {reg4?her:him}.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_result_2|There may be other work, of course -- nobles and guildmasters often have needs we aren't supposed to know about. Also, the villages around here frequently need help, although they'd be more likely to pay you with a wedge of cheese and goodwill than with silver.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:close_window|I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_cap_ask|I need to hire a captain. Would you know of any suitable person?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask:tavernkeeper_cap_ask_1|A lot of people pass by this tavern, I couldn't know everyone. Maybe if you help me to refresh my memories...{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask:tavernkeeper_talk|Nope, sorry. Anything else?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask_1:tavernkeeper_cap_ask_2|Would 10 piastres shake them up?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask_1:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Not this time.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask_2:tavernkeeper_talk|I've met a guy named {s1}. I think he was heading to {s2}. I also heard of one {s3}, he must be residing at {s4} now. Anything else?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_cap_ask_2:tavernkeeper_talk.1|I've met a guy named {s1}. I think he was heading to {s2}.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_lord_ask|Have you any fresh rumors of political nature?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_lord_ask:tavernkeeper_lord_ask_1|A little, {sir/m'am}. A sound of piastres would do wonders to my memory...{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_lord_ask:tavernkeeper_talk|Nope, sorry. Anything else?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_lord_ask_1:tavernkeeper_lord_ask_2|Here's a fifty for your troubles.{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_lord_ask_1:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Not this time.{***}

dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_players|I've got coins to spare. Do you know any people who enjoy some gambling?{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_players:tavernkeeper_pretalk|{s50}{***}
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.{***}
dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Why, hello, {s0}. I am sure this encounter will be benefical for us both.{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|What are you talking about?{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|You have the bearing of an adventurer, and here in the New World, adventures tend to involve fighting. A lot of it, really. Then, when the smoke clears, sometimes there are a few poor sods who weren't men enough to go down in a blaze of glory. As a good Christian I am sure you are, you would probably have mercy on these unfortunates, offer them food and shelter, escort them to the coast... And then I'll be here to provide them with wonderful new employment opportunities. See, many plantations are woefully understaffed...{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|So you buy captives as slaves, then. How much do you pay?{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|Good money. How about, 300 piastres per head? Sure, you might earn more by taking them to the customer directly, but that's a long trip, and captives are notoriously hard to keep in check when they aren't locked up in a ship's hold.{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|I'll keep that in mind.{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|So, have you any excess mouths you want to feed no longer?{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|I have some captives for you.{***}
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...{***}

dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I have travelled all around the Caribbean, always keeping an open ear. If you need any information, I can provide you with it. For a price, of course.{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about these lands?{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|The Caribbean is divided among the colonial empires. Each of them would love to drive the others out and claim the New World for themselves alone, but this is beyond their individual power.And so they keep fighting, making peace, conducting alliances, switching sides, and fighting again.A good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself, not so good for a man of peaceful trade.With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power.Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|What kind of opportunities?{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|Another option for an enterprising individual would be to support the claims of a viceroy's enemies.Revolutionaries, disinherited heirs and secret schemers are abound in these lands, each seeking a way to topple the current representative of the European power and claim the colonies for their own.{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these upstarts?{***}
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|They tend to avoid the colonies of their own realm, of course.They usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause.I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision.But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.{***}

dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Of course, some adventurers risk striking out on their own, owing allegiance to none.

dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {most noble sir/most noble lady}.{***}
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?{***}
dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the nobles of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Can I answer any other questions for you?{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Some nobles make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other nobles of your land, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.{***}
dlga_minstrel_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Do you have any other questions?{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a viceroy or a governor will hold a ball. They will often be accompanied by tournaments. The balls provide a chance for the nobles to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.{***}
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of the Caribbean.{***}
dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. Their daughters are political assets, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Romeo and Juliett in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.{***}
dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.{***}
dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?{***}
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.{***}
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?{***}
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.{***}
dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...{***}
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.{***}

dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any poems?{***}
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you some sonnets of Shakespeare. His plays were all the roar in England half a century ago, but he wrote a plenty of love poetry, too. The sonnets are fairly short and can be easily learned. The poet's reason and love battle for influence over him, but love has the upper hand, and he succumbs to his passion, knowing it will do him no good. The sonnets will be appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.{***}

dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?{***}
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area.I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.{***}
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.{***}
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.{***}
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself.Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others.Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield.Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent.This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield.Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction.That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts.Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack.In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack.If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.{***}
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?{***}
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say.A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it.[You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon.If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction[You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill.There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely.[to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].{***}
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.{***}
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat.It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback.However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit.[To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons.after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]{***}
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.{***}
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?{***}
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.{***}
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before.To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.{***}

dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.{***}
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.{***}

From now on your opponents will be champion fighters.These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.{***}

dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?{***}
dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We expect to begin production in about {reg4} days{***}
dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} piastres each week, while the quantity of {s4} required to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep cost {reg3}.{s9} This means we make a {s12} of {reg0} piastres a week. In theory, that is -- assuming that we have to stock up on raw materials, and that we sell directly to the market.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you wish anything else?{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventory.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell the goods as they are produced.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain how do I run my enterprise?{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us purchase raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the local markets. Because of our longstanding relations with the merchants here, we can usually get a very good price.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may deliver them to our warehouses, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in the warehouses for you to take.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} piastres.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.{***}
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.{***}

dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Good job, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I needed. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out.I'm afraid I won't be purchasing any more goods, nor put bounties on marauders, but you're welcome to keep hunting them if any remain.Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.{***}
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again, {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully.I will tell the merchants how reliable you are.And here is your pay, {reg8} piastres.{***}

dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. A band of outlaws attacked me on the way.{***}
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, you've signed up to deliver the herd safely, no matter what.The owner of the herd demanded compensation for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 piastres from my own funds.You owe me that money now.{***}

dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let other merchants know that you are clear of any debts now.{***}
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?{***}
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|What is your trade, my good man?{***}
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I run the day to day affairs of the town of {s9}, while our esteemed governor is busy fighting and reveling.{***}
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|And who is that governor of yours?{***}
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|{s10} rules this town. The governor rarely blesses us with his radiant presence, though, other than to feast in the palace, collect taxes or sign up some naive fools to die in his battles. Most of time, we are left alone, and I am the closest thing we have for management here.{***}
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|I see. Thank you.{***}

dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|As of late, there was some fighting near the {s5}.In the resulting chaos, some of our less upstanding citizens resorted to looting the shops and plantations in the area.They stole a lot of valuable goods, and somebody's got to teach these bastards a lesson.Care to take it up?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Sure, I'll do that.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Good. You'll find the marauders roaming the countryside, looking for more good people to rob.Kill them or capture them, I don't really care.I'll pay you a bounty of 40 piastres on every marauding gang you destroy,until all of them are dealt with.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I am not interested.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to give battle to {s7}.

dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief:close_window|Very good. Chances are, some other travellers managed to spot the gang around the area.{***}

dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice|I want you to find these {s4} and put them to sword. The town had enough of their depredations.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4|Who are these warmongers you speak of?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5|{s12} of {s15} and {s13} of {s14}. As long as they don't change their mind nor fall from their liege's grace,there will be no peace between the two sides.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6|And how do I come into the picture?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|Well, someone just has to either make them change their mind, or lose their influence. Sounds easy, eh?A determined, convincing speaker might be able to persuade them to lay down their arms and embrace like brothers. Stranger things used to happen, not often though.And then there is a realistic, if difficult, way -- beat them both up in battle and take them prisoner. They won't be influential much in a dungeon.Once both are safely locked up, the peace talks may finally proceed. And who knows, they might come to terms themselves if chained in one cell, haha.So what do you think? Sounds challenging enough for you?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|Just about as ambitious as I love it.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|The merchants of the city will be glad to pay anything to make the war stop.We can collect {reg12} piastres between ourselves, I reckon.Bring us peace, and we will be happy to reward you with that sum.Convince {s12} and {s13} to reconcile,and if either of them proves too stubborn, defeat him and lock him up until a settlement is reached.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do what I can.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10:close_window|Excellent. You have our prayers.I hope you can handle those two warthogs.We will wait for the good news.{***}

dlga_merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits:merchant_quest_stall|Uh, umm, I don't think I could handle them alone.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_brief|The cattle herd must be at {s13} within 30 days. The sooner the better, of course,but it must be absolutely no later than 30 days.If you can do that, I'd be willing to pay you {reg8} piastres for your trouble. Interested?{***}
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_taken|Yes, I can drive the herd to {s13}.{***}

dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, but no.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is something important you could do for us indeed. You may have heard about an occasional {s10} incursion on our territory. While {s5} is hard-pressed by {reg0?her:his} nobles to respond with an all-out attack, we would rather maintain the uneasy peace. Peace is good for trade, you know.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|Of course, we are not suggesting it that {s5} should bend over and tolerate their impudence, not at all. But if {reg0?she:he} demands one of {reg0?her:his} governors to enact proper retribution, this will invariably lead to a war. On the other hand, if an outsider steps in and puts a particularly insufferable {s10} noble into place, that could restore some order without making us both slide towards open warfare. Take {s7}, for instance -- even other {s10} leaders wouldn't particularly mind it if he gets a lesson taught to him.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|Just {s4}, some travellers en route {reg4?to:from} {s5} were attacked by {s7}.{***}

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for an able mercenary to do some bounty-hunting business.You see, a band of pirates has infested the local countryside as of late.They are preying on my caravans and ships alike for some time,and keep slipping away from the soldiers sent to punish them.A few more such attacks, and I am completely broke.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Actually, I do have the utmost need of a {man/helper} of discretion.There is a... certain woman I hold very dear to me. Unfortunately, that became known to a gang of outlaws. The bastards have kidnapped her, and demand ransom for her release.I am willing to pay them anything, but there are... certain issues preventing me from handling the matter myself. My wife, my social standing, you have to understand.So, someone else has to meet them in secrecy and buy back the freedom of the woman in question.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|The war between {s15} and {s14} is devastating for our trade.Our fleet is being preyed upon by warships and privateers.The merchants fear to leave the relative safety of the walls.And to add insult to an injury, the rising war taxes take away anything we manage to make despite the odds.A few more weeks of fighting, and this town is as good as gone.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_brief|The times are hard for your citizens. But who can leash back the hounds of war?{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty as subjects to help your betters in their war effort.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Oh really? Our 'betters' fight their wars for the sake of their vanity and greed.And yet it is us honest folk who have to pay for the noble ambitions with our silver and our blood.But you are obviously too stuck up to understand that.{***}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits|That I do. The city streets after dark are never safe, but as of late, 'unsafe' has got a whole new meaning.Some new gang is out there, preying on tonwnspeople in the nighttime then disappearing before any guard could so much as spot them.There were numerous assaults, and yet we weren't able to catch just one of them.They only attack lone travellers, and so far dared not to ambush armed groups.That's where you come in.

dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5b:close_window|I should have you whipped and hanged, you scum. Go and do not return without my money!{***}
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some inquiries about local politics.{***}
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good God, the guild wants nothing to do with politics. We are loyal subjects of {s10}. We just look after our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our governors, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?{***}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What causes all these wars in the region?{***}
dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|This is a new, untamed world ripe for plundering, that's what. Spain were here first, and claimed the Americas for their own, but they couldn't keep the others out. The English, the French, the Dutch, they all come here looking for whatever scraps they can grab and hold. Then there is the Brotherhood of the Coast, whom even Spain has to grudgingly tolerate as a power in its own right. Add infighting between the protestants and the catholics, and you get a hotbed of conflict.{***}
dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|The truth is, it is difficult to achieve a lasting success so far from Europe. Burning some villages and sinking a few ships is not that hard, but taking over an entire colony, that's normally beyond the abilities of a Viceroy, or a Governor General, what have you. Not to mention everyone is quickly up to gangband on whoever threatens to upset the balance of power. Often, a ruler will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some hotheads at the court will demand retribution, and the authority of a ruler would suffer greatly were he to ignore the offense. I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority.{***}
dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|Mind you, we in the guild try to stay away from politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my humble advice, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} intent to rule over the Americas is perfectly reasonable, wars are bad for business -- and what is bad for business, is bad for the coffers of the realm.{***}
dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you ever meet {reg4?her:him}. No need to mention my name -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a {reg4?her:his} decisions.{***}
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?{***}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other powers in the Caribbean?{***}
dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which power did you have in mind?{***}
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}{***}
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}{***}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?{***}
dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support {reg4?her:his} claim to the rulership of the Americas. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...{***}
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The nobles in the colonies often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.{***}
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a noble may abandon his liege, and pledge his services to another. In theory, each noble has sworn an oath to their ruler, but in practice, they oft find excuses to absolve themselves. The noble may claim that the ruler has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the noble and treat him justly. Or, the noble may claim that his ruler is in fact an usurper, and another has a better claim to rule.{***}
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Rulers and governors still watch each other carefully. If a liege believes that a noble of his realm is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the noble for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a noble fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the governor's holdings.{***}
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a noble who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a ruler who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a noble and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in {s4}.{***}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.{***}

dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this city compare to the rest of the region?{***}
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_1:mayor_wealth_comparison_2|{s4} is considered the richest city in the Caribbean these days. Here in {s5}, we are poorer than {reg4} towns and more prosperous than {reg5}.{***}
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_2:mayor_wealth_comparison_3|Concerning the industry, {s4} is considered the most productive town in the region. Here in {s5}, we produce less than {reg4} towns, and more than {reg5}. Of course, production is affected by the supply of raw resources and the overall prosperity of the town.{***}
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_3:mayor_wealth_comparison_4|The hinterland of the town of {s4} is spoken of as the most prosperous in all the Americas. Here in {s5}, the surrounding villages produce less than the counryside around {reg4} towns, and more than {reg5}. Naturally, the wealth of a town's hinterland depends heavily on the tides of war. Looting and pillage make a massive impact.{***}
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_4:mayor_wealth_comparison_5|In terms of trade, the town of {s4} is believed to have received more caravans than any other over the past few months. Here in {s5}, we trade less than {reg4} towns, and more than {reg5}.{***}
dlga_mayor_wealth_comparison_5:mayor_pretalk|As for the public safety, the town of {s4} is said to be the most dangerous to the travelers. Here in {s5}, we are less plagued by outlaws and pirates than {reg4} towns, but {reg5} towns are considered safer than us.{***}
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise.{***}
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second business.{***}
dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one business here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?{***}
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain.{***}
dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, sir. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} piastres. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} piastres each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} piastres a week. Of course, these numbers are speculative, providing that prices remain constant -- which, I assure you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?{***}
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.{***}
dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your business should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, speak to your {s4} about its operations.{***}
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No, that's not unfeasible for me right now.{***}

dlga_village_elder_ransom_p:close_window|Just wanted to pay my respects, Sir.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_2:village_elder_ransom_2_p|How quaint. Technically, this is against the rules, but I could look the other way if you get me interested enough. Say, how much would you value your freedom? Is it worth {reg0} piastres?{***}

dlga_village_elder_ransom_2_p:village_elder_ransom_5|That's too expensive for me, Sir.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_3:village_elder_ransom_3_p|Splendid. Sign a bill of exchange, and you'll be free as soon as my messenger receives yours coins from a banker.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_3_p:close_window|I'll pray for his safety, Sir.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_4:village_elder_ransom_4_p|Sorry, I haven't heard you. I said, is it worth {reg0} piastres?{***}

dlga_village_elder_ransom_4_p:village_elder_ransom_5|What? Oh, I see... I can't pay that much. {***}

dlga_village_elder_ransom_6_p:close_window|Why, thank you, Sir.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_7:village_elder_ransom_7_p|What? Do you take me for a fool or something? I repeat, your freedom costs... {reg0} piastres.{***}

dlga_village_elder_ransom_8:village_elder_ransom_8_p|What, again? You begin to annoy me, slave. Have you got {reg0} piastres or not?{***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_8_p:village_elder_ransom_3|Yes, Sir, I will pay. {***}
dlga_village_elder_ransom_8_p:village_elder_ransom_5|Sorry, I can't pay that much.  {***}
dlga_start:village_elder_deliver_cattle_thank|My good {sir/madame}, our village is forever in your debt. Thanks to the {reg5} heads of cattle you have brought, we can now restore our own herd.{***}

dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_active_mission_1|About that job...{***}
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_1:village_elder_active_mission_2|Yes, {sir/madam}. What of it?{***}
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_deliver_grain_thank|Indeed. Here are {reg5} sacks of grain for you.{***}

dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_tell_mission|A task?{***}
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission|{My good sir/My good lady}, our village has hit the hard times.Not only the last harvest has been bad, but a gang of brigands stole our seed grain reserved for the planting season.If we cannot find some grain soon, we will not be able to plant our fields and will have nothing to eat for the coming year.If you can help us, we would be indebted to you forever.{***}
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmmm. How much grain do you need?{***}
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} sacks of grain will be enough to let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find some kind people to help us with the rest.{***}

dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask someone else.{***}
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission|A gang of brigands has taken up to preying upon our village. They take our food and livestock, kill everyone who dares to defy them, beat us for laughs.Our folk is desperate to overthrow their yoke, but we are simple peasants, untrained to fight and bereft of good weapons.We need an experienced warrior to train our young men to fight the opressors.{***}
dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept|I can teach you how to fight.{***}
dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept:close_window|You will? Oh, that's wonderful! I'll gather the village folk here to receive your training. If you can teach us how to defend ourselves, we'll give you everything we can in return for your efforts.{***}

dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission|Bandits have driven away our cattle, and our pastures are empty. We need a few heads of cattle so we could start to raise a herd again.{***}

dlga_village_elder_ask_enemies:village_elder_pretalk|Not at all, Lord bless. And I hope I never will.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_enemies:village_elder_tell_enemies|Hmm. Let me think about it...{***}

dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_set_fire|I want you to start a large fire on the outskirts of the village.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:close_window|We have already agreed upon this, {s0}. I will do my best. You can trust me.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_1|A fire, {s0}? It may burn the village to the ground! Why would you want such a thing?{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_1:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I have my own reasons. As for yours -- does a purse full of silver sound convincing enough?{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_9|As you wish, {s0}. You have been a good friend to this village, and, even though there is a risk, we should be glad to return the favor. When do you want this fire to start?{***}

dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_10:close_window|Very well, {sir/my lady}. We will make our preparations. Now you make yours.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_9:village_elder_ask_set_fire_11|Do this in at the stroke of midnight. I will wait exactly one hour.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_11:close_window|As you wish, {sir/my lady}. May the Lord protects you.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:close_window|I'm sorry, {s0}. Forgive me for saying this, but we have little reason to trust you. This is too dangerous.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_3|As you say, {s0}. But in doing this, we are taking a very great risk. What's in it for us?{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_4|I can give you 100 piastres.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_4:village_elder_talk|This is insane. I cannot take such a risk!{***}
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_recruit_start|I am looking to recruit some soldiers. Any lads in your village willing to go and experience the world?{***}

dlga_village_elder_talk:close_window|Farewell, for now.{***}
dlga_village_elder_recruit_start:village_elder_recruit_decision|I can think of {reg5} whom I suspect would jump at the chance, if you could pay 10 piastres {reg7?each for their equipment:for his equipment}.Does that suit you?{***}
dlga_village_elder_recruit_decision:village_elder_pretalk|Tell {reg7?them:him} to make ready.{***}

dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_explain_plan:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I need to rescue a prisoner from {s4}. When you light the fire, the guards in {s4} will see the smoke, and some of them will rush outside to see what is going on.{***}

dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:close_window|Nevermind.{***}
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_5.1|We have discussed this before, {s0}, and your offer was too modest next to the risk you want me to take.{***}

The watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the frontiers -- fewer men to keep an eye on the streets -- but I'm not sure what to make of that. It seems to me that the most logical explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls, who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting targets...

dlga_camp01francois01:camp01francois02|Glad to hear it. As far as I am aware, you are known as {playername}. And my name is Francois, seigneur de la Bigotiere. A scholar of the law both canon and common, along with many other sciences. These arts have attracted my attention to the people of Maya, whose cities still stand in the jungles of Iucatania.{***}
dlga_camp01francois02:camp01francois02_|Despite their heathen barbarism, these people knew much about the art of mathematics - a learning that amazes me. Perhaps their very barbarism is the reason of their unique insights, for the Devil himself could have helped them to understand the nature of the universe and the laws that govern numbers. So I left France and moved here, eventually discovering many a mystery of the empires of old. Their secrets are pure gold, I tell you. Would you want to hear more?{***}
dlga_camp01francois02_:camp01francois03|With pleasure, monsieur de la Bijoutiere.{***}
dlga_camp01francois03:camp01francois04|Oh please, Francois is enough. But if you insist on using my title, it's Bi-GO-tiere. The Mayans have uncovered many secrets of mathematics, and mind you, numbers is what makes this world go round.{***}
dlga_camp01francois04:camp01francois04_|The magic of numbers will help us find a way to treasures so unfathomable that the gold of Aztecs pillaged by Cortes will look like a fistful of denier stolen from a beggar in comparison. Denier is french small change, in case you are not aware. So, do you wish to join this endeavor?{***}
dlga_camp01francois04_:camp01francois05|It's a honor, Francois. When we begin?{***}
dlga_camp01francois05:camp01francois05_|We will meet again in a tavern in Puerto Plata. Head there at once, I will catch up with you in a moment, as I need to meet up with another likely participant of our endeavor.{***}
dlga_camp01francois05_:close_window|Fine, we'll meet in Puerto Plata.{***}
dlga_camp01francois05_:camp01francois07|A tavern in Puerto Plata? How do you know there is a tavern in there?{***}
dlga_camp01francois07:camp01francois07_|Monsieur, I've been there a plenty of times. Not the most luxurious place, of course, but good enough for a business lunch.{***}
dlga_camp01francois07_:camp01francois07a2|My lord, I know it for certain that the city guard detains anyone looking for that tavern! Moreover, the guards throw these unfortunates into the dungeon and attempt to hang them! Most importantly, there is no tavern to begin with!{***}
dlga_camp01francois07a2:camp01francois08|I know the ending of your story all too well. In place of the treasure I'll find but a tattered hat, and that's a best case scenario. And you are about to be hanged, by the way! But... you were supposed to be in the prison...{***}
dlga_camp01francois08:camp01francois08_|You speak like a madman, my friend. Are you feeling all right?{***}
dlga_camp01francois08_:camp01francois08a1|I don't know, Francois, my head is spinning...{***}
dlga_camp01francois08a1:close_window|I don't know, Francois, my head is spinning. You might be a noble man, I don't know, but I've got a feeling I should stay away from you and from Puerto Plata. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp01francois08_:close_window|Nevermind, I am all right. It's all the climate. Let's meet in Puerto Plata.{***}
dlga_camp01francois04_:camp01francois04c1|Your speech sounds like a speech of a madman, and a dangerous one at that...{***}
dlga_camp01francois04c1:close_window|Dear monsieur the count of France, or the lawyer, or the accountant, or whoever you are. Your speech sounds like a speech of a madman, and a dangerous one at that. I am unwilling to associate with the likes of you, I have no need of dubious adventures, and I assure you I am perfectly capable of getting rich, making enemies or entertaining myself without your involvement. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp01francois02_:close_window|Oh no, not the tales about treasures and Puerto Plata taverns!{***}
dlga_camp01francois00_:camp01francois00b1|I have to note that the last french swindler I had a honor to encounter ended up looking miserable indeed...{***}
dlga_camp01francois00b1:camp01francois09|I have to note that the last french swindler I had a honor to encounter ended up looking miserable indeed, due to a bullet hole through his head. What do you want to tell me, dear friend?{***}
dlga_camp01francois09:camp01francois09_|I want to tell you that your manners leave much to be desired, but it can be fixed given time. And I have all the time in the world. As a matter of fact, it was this time that allowed me to discover the treasures of Maya, but since you apparently have no interest in that, may I...{***}
dlga_camp01francois09_:camp01francois10|The treasures of Maya? Could you elaborate on that?{***}
dlga_camp01francois10:camp01francois11|I only wish your curiousity was aroused by a cerebral interest in antiques, not a base greed.{***}
dlga_camp01francois11:camp01francois12|The Mayan civilization draws men of noble intellect, while base minds are pursuing the unholy gold of Aztecs and Incas. Glad to see you realize that too.{***}
dlga_camp01francois12:camp01francois12_|I could have given you a few lessons about this mysterious people and its achievements, but I am sure your companions need some rest. Let us rendezvous in Puerto Plata and discuss the details of our endeavor in a tavern?{***}
dlga_camp01francois12_:close_window|Very well, 'til Puerto Plata then.{***}
dlga_camp01francois12_:camp01francois12b1|No way, master Frenchman...{***}
dlga_camp01francois12b1:close_window|No way, master Frenchman. I have no interest in your lessons. I may look like an escaped convict or a retired officer, even seem a merchant or a pirate, but I definitely don't look anywhere near an insane bookworm begging to be burnt by the Inquisition and the good puritans alike. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp01francois09_:close_window|Oh no, not the tales about treasures and Puerto Plata taverns!{***}
dlga_event_triggered:camp07jorge00_|Your new vessel, she's a beauty, isn't she, senor? No such thing as too many ships, that's what I think... So, back to our endeavor. Hiring a bunch of cutthroats willing to brave the local jungles would be a good start.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge00_:camp07jorge01|I thought the plan is to loot the Spanish convoys. What would we need in the jungles?{***}
dlga_camp07jorge01:camp07jorge01_|I mentioned treasures while we were on the run. Now is as good a time as any to divulge the details.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge01_:camp07jorge02|Couldn't agree more. Treasures are a conversation topic that I am most fond of.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge02:camp07jorge02_|Glad to hear. You might know that the Castillians weren't driven by their lust for gold alone when they brought ruin to the Aztec empire. First and foremost, they were scared of the Aztec religion. Hearts cut out, rotting heads piled in mounds next to the pyramids, all that jolly stuff.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge02_:camp07jorge03|And that's why the Spaniards of Cortes have decided to decimate the natives, to end their suffering?{***}
dlga_camp07jorge03:camp07jorge04|Your irony misses the point, senor. We might live in an enlightened age of piracy and absolutism, but things were different back in the days of Cortes. His father could have enlisted to fight in the Hundred Years war, were he stupid enough to do so.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge04:camp07jorge04_|But I would rather continue this conversation after you dispatch of those two pirates ships coming downwind.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge04_:camp07jorge05|Why do you think they are pirates?{***}
dlga_camp07jorge05:camp07jorge05_|Oh, there are two omens a person of experience may notice. For one, they fly the 'Jolly Roger', that black flag bearing skull and crossbones. More importantly, they are already firing the warning shots. I suggest you to take my word on it and commit to the battle.{***}
dlga_camp07jorge05_:close_window|Aye aye, my dear Jorge. Ready the guns! Helmsman, set a course towards this sailing trough!{***}
dlga_event_triggered:camp08jorge00_|That was a fine battle, senor. I am enchanted to witness that you are as good with your ship as you are with your cutlass - if the Puerto Plata experience is anything to go by.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge00_:camp08jorge01|These rascals had to be taught a lesson. They interrupted a most entertaining conversation about Aztec gold.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge01:camp08jorge01_|Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi, as they say. The conversation was, in fact, about the Aztec mysticism. Before I continue, I want you to memorize a name. Ponce de Leon.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge01_:camp08jorge02|What is he famous for?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge02:camp08jorge02_|For gaining immortality, apparently.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge02_:camp08jorge03|Oh really? As a result of the famous Spaniard piety, I suppose?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge03:camp08jorge03_|My Bible is rusty, but I vaguely recall an event involving the prophet Elias. It appears the most piety could do for you is taking you to the Heavens above in the flesh. Not quite the immortality for the laymen down below. No, Ponce de Leon has reached immortality in a purely physical sense, by the means not exactly approved by the Holy Inquisition.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge03_:camp08jorge04|If I had to take a guess, Aztecs are somehow involved?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge04:camp08jorge04_|Precisely. The Fountain of Youth is the source of his immortality, and the answer to the puzzle lies in de Leon's lost notes.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge04_:camp08jorge05|I am impatient to hear your plan, dear senor.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge05:camp08jorge05_|But I not that impatient to outline it.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge05_:camp08jorge06|What?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge06:camp08jorge07|Apologies, but I had an opportunity to evaluate your performance first in melee, and later on the quarterdeck. To say I am depressed would be an understatement.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge07:camp08jorge08|Admittingly, potential is strong in this one, but for the time being, you look pathetic.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge08:camp08jorge09|There is a certain young dutchman, recently relieved of his duties to the East India Company for some acts of debauchery all over La Habana. I guess he would make a better applicant.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge09:camp08jorge09_|Not to mention the legendary John Silver himself, the infamous pirate who has offered me his services.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge09_:camp08jorge10|You know, dear Jorge, I am pondering over the most unpleasant ways to kill you on the spot.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge10:camp08jorge10_|That won't be necessary, I assure you. We can make a deal yet, if you impress me enough. Besides, you were kind of helpful in that prison after all.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge10_:camp08jorge11|What it would take to impress you then?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge11:camp08jorge11_|Head to Belize and look for one McGonagall, also known as 'the Weaver'. He's an acquaintance of mine, able to offer many a valuable advice.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge11_:camp08jorge12|Is he some kind of a local military prodigy?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge12:camp08jorge12_|He is some kind of a local great Scottish poet, or at least he thinks of himself as such. Truth be told, he is actually Irish. Still, McGonagall knows a plenty about warfare, and his advices are best heeded.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge12_:camp08jorge13|Thanks, I guess. I will look around for this McGonagall. But how would I find you? I take it you are going to part ways with me?{***}
dlga_camp08jorge13:camp08jorge13_|Yes, I will go ashore at the nearest port. Worry not, I will find you myself when I'll need that.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge13_:close_window|You do that.{***}
dlga_camp08jorge12_:close_window|Jorge, I used to believe that glint in your eyes is a sign of bravery, but now I see it as an omen of madness. Good bye.{***}
dlga_event_triggered:center_captured_lord_advice|My {lord/lady}, we surrender! Please order your troops to stop their rampage. On behalf of the citizens of {s10}, I offer you the tribute of {reg3} piastres if you leave us in peace.{***}
dlga_event_triggered:center_captured_rebellion|{s1} is not being managed by anyone. Whom shall I appoint as a governor?{***}
dlga_event_triggered:dplmc_companion_threaten_request_response|At last I've found you, {s21}. I have returned from my mission to {s31}.{***}
dlga_dplmc_companion_threaten_request_response:companion_rejoin_response|They paid {s21} piastres and are expecting that you leave them alone. I agreed on a truce of 40 days.{***}
dlga_companion_rejoin_response:close_window|Welcome back, friend!{***}
dlga_companion_rejoin_response:companion_rejoin_refused|Unfortunately, I cannot take you back just yet.{***}
dlga_companion_rejoin_refused:close_window|As you wish. I will take care of some business, and try again in a few days.{***}
dlga_dplmc_companion_threaten_request_response:companion_rejoin_response.1|They send you a declaration of war.{***}
dlga_dplmc_companion_threaten_request_response:companion_rejoin_response.2|They are not willing to fold facing your threats.{***}
dlga_event_triggered:companion_rejoin_response|At last I've found you, {s21}. I have returned from my mission to {s31}. They were agreeably surprised.{***}
dlga_event_triggered:dplmc_companion_prisoner_exchange_confirm|At last I've found you, {s21}. They agreed to exchange {s32} against {s33}. {s33} has accompanied me back here. Do you want to set {s32} free?{***}

dlga_dplmc_companion_prisoner_exchange_confirm:companion_rejoin_response.1|No, do not set him free.{***}

dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.6|{s12} says that {reg0?she:he} is unwilling to conclude a peace.{***}
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.7|{s12} says that you are already pledged to another ruler.{***}
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.8|{s12} says that {reg0?she:he} does not believe that you would honor your obligations as a noble of the realm, and suspects that your offer is just a ploy.{***}
dlga_companion_embassy_results:vassalage_offer_confirm|{s12} says that {reg0?she:he} accepts your offer of service. {reg0?She:He} will give you 30 days to seek {reg0?her:him} out, in which time {reg0?she:he} will refrain from making war on you.{***}

dlga_member_personal_mission_report:close_window|Hm. Very interesting, but I'm happier to have you back.{***}
dlga_member_personal_mission_report:companion_rejoin_refused|Hm. Very interesting. Unfortunately, I cannot take you back just yet.{***}
dlga_event_triggered:companion_rejoin_response.7|Would you have me rejoin you?{***}

dlga_sell_prisoner_outlaws:sell_prisoner_outlaws|Hmmm. 10 piastres for each looter makes {reg1} piastres for all {reg0} of them.{***}
dlga_sell_prisoner_outlaws:sell_prisoner_outlaws.1|Let me see. You've brought {reg0} bandits, so 20 piastres for each comes up to {reg1} piastres.{***}

dlga_party_relieved:close_window|Thank you for helping us against those bastards.{***}
dlga_camp09mac00_:camp09mac01|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp09mac00_:camp09mac08|Mister McGonagall, senor Jorge told me to find you.{***}
dlga_camp09mac01:camp09mac01_|The climate is bracing, and the walks lovely to see.^Besides, ye can ramble over the district, and view the beautiful scenery.{***}
dlga_camp09mac01_:camp09mac02|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp09mac01_:camp09mac08|Mister McGonagall, senor Jorge told me to find you.{***}
dlga_camp09mac02:camp09mac02_|The town is admirably situated from the cold winter winds,^And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds,{***}
dlga_camp09mac02_:camp09mac03|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp09mac02_:camp09mac08|Mister McGonagall, senor Jorge told me to find you.{***}
dlga_camp09mac03:camp09mac03_|Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free,^Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily.{***}
dlga_camp09mac03_:camp09mac04|Sir, your poetry is astounding. Two hundred years ahead of time, no less.{***}
dlga_camp09mac04:camp09mac04_|Thank you, young {man/woman}. It's a rare sight to meet a purveyor of fine poetry amidst these filthy plebeians. How come?{***}
dlga_camp09mac04_:camp09mac10|Well, stuff happens.{***}
dlga_camp09mac04_:camp09mac05|Certain circumstances forced me to leave Europe. Hearing the melodic Edinburgh accent in this jungle is a pleasant change.{***}
dlga_camp09mac05:camp09mac05_|Then you are a Scotsman too?{***}
dlga_camp09mac05_:camp09mac06|Partly. My mother hails from the village of Glencoe, McDonald clan.{***}
dlga_camp09mac06:camp09mac06_|Not a true Scotsman, then?{***}
dlga_camp09mac06_:camp09mac07|True enough, but here is hardly a place to argue that.{***}
dlga_camp09mac07:camp09mac10|Doesn't matter, young {man/woman}. Please, if your mother is alive still, write her to move someplace else from Glencoe. And don't trust the Campbells!{***}
dlga_camp09mac08:camp09mac08_|Whoa, I haven't heard from him for a long, long time. Is he alive still?{***}
dlga_camp09mac08_:camp09mac09|Sure, we parted ways just a little while ago.{***}
dlga_camp09mac09:camp09mac09_|Excellent. You must be a representative of the Edinburgh printing house? Mister Jorge has promised to arrange our meeting several months ago.{***}
dlga_camp09mac09_:camp09mac10|Not quite. As a matter of fact, he pointed me to you for an advice on all matters military.{***}
dlga_camp09mac10:camp09mac10_|So how may I be of help, {mister/lady}...?{***}
dlga_camp09mac10_:camp09mac11|Frankly, mister McGonagall, I am not even sure I need your help.{***}
dlga_camp09mac11:camp09mac12|Look, young {man/woman}. I am old Scotsman who remembers many battles. I watch you and I see that you are doomed to perish or to end up a slave on the plantations in Brazil, which is hardly a better alternative.{***}
dlga_camp09mac12:camp09mac12_|I'll give you a couple of free lessons. And if you plan to assure me you already have some kind of experience, please don't. Hereabouts, your experience is useless. So tonight, after an evening of poetry, we'll schedule a raid on a camp of slave traders.{***}
dlga_camp09mac12_:camp09mac13|I thought your advices would be more on a theoretical side, sir.{***}
dlga_camp09mac12_:close_window|Afraid not, sir. I don't believe I can survive through another of your poems. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp09mac13:camp09mac13_|Whether you aspire to study the poetry of a word or the poetry of war, you'd have to practice a lot. We'll continue our readings for now, and then will proceed to the fine art of warfare. If you have any retinue following you around, they may rest in the city, we won't need excess men in our battle.{***}
dlga_camp09mac13_:close_window|Very well.{***}
dlga_camp09mac13_:close_window.1|I fear I can't survive through another of your poems. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp10mac01:camp10mac02|The troop of horse is best deployed on a flank, to surround the adversary once the battle is committed.{***}
dlga_camp10mac02:camp10mac02_|Sure, you could order to charge right away, but I recommend to hold your ground first and meet the enemy on our conditions. Just don't let these rascals to cut through our musketeers. Always keep the musketeers safe! Once you see the enemy giving way, order the charge. Good luck, young {man/woman}. I'll dedicate you a poem if you make it through.{***}
dlga_camp10mac02_:close_window|I bet you will.{***}
dlga_camp11mac00_:camp11mac04|No, no! Well, I mean yes, nice battle, sir, what do we plan now, sir?{***}
dlga_camp11mac00_:camp11mac01|(Brace yourself for the poetry...){***}
dlga_camp11mac01:camp11mac02|Sir Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn^Beat the English in every wheel and turn,{***}
dlga_camp11mac02:camp11mac03|And made them fly in great dismay^From off the field without delay.{***}
dlga_camp11mac03:camp11mac03_|The English were a hundred thousand strong,^And King Edward passed through the Lowlands all along.{***}
dlga_camp11mac03_:camp11mac04|Very nice, but could we finish it another time?{***}
dlga_camp11mac04:camp11mac04_|Whatever. We have helped the oppressed and crushed the vile. Still, it's only a small troop from the immense empire of slavery which flourishes in these lands. I expect you to be eager to strike a blow into the very heart of this unholy enterprise?{***}
dlga_camp11mac04_:camp11mac04a1|Totally. Nothing pleases me more than fighting your battles for you...{***}
dlga_camp11mac04a1:camp11mac05|Totally. Nothing pleases me more than fighting your battles for you.^^Moreover, your poetry awakens some stirring deep within my innermost self, feelings and strengths I did not suspect myself of possessing.{***}
dlga_camp11mac04_:camp11mac04b1|I am afraid I'll end up institutionalized the Bedlam if I keep listening to you...{***}
dlga_camp11mac04b1:camp11mac04b2|I am afraid I'll end up institutionalized the Bedlam if I keep listening to you. Dear McGonagall, I just can't trust a person who cannot decide whether he is a weaver, a poet or a soldier. How about I leave you here in the jungle to read your rhymes to the parrots? That might cause an extinction of natives in this area, but it can't be helped.{***}
dlga_camp11mac04b2:close_window|I swear, no human being can listen to your verses for longer than a few minutes without losing their sanity. I hope that man from Edinburgh Jorge has promised to you will never find you. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp11mac05:camp11mac05_|Excellent, my friend. Now we must head towards Bluefields at once. Your merry fleet may stay at Belize harbor for now, for our friends will help us with the means of transportation. Follow me.{***}
dlga_camp11mac05_:close_window|Very well.{***}
dlga_camp12mac00_:close_window|Let's do it.{***}
dlga_camp13mac00_:camp13mac01|Actually, there are a few things... Like, how would I hire the bloody soldiers? Where may I procure a cannon or three? Why the locals look at me like I am covered in shit or something?{***}
dlga_camp13mac01:camp13mac02|Oh, that's simple enough. They don't know you, that's all. Fight, make yourself a name, defeat adversaries stronger than you, and fight some more, and your options will expand along with your renown.{***}
dlga_camp13mac02:camp13mac03|Governors of the colonies won't allow you to hire their soldiers until you enter the service of their nation. Even the Brethren of the Coast is jealously hoarding its manpower, or so I was told. It goes without mention that nobody would sell a cannon to some suspicious stranger.{***}
dlga_camp13mac03:camp13mac04|As long as you remain an unknown variable, look for mercenary bands made of locals, they welcome any sort of work. And keep working on your renown, whatever it takes.{***}
dlga_camp13mac04:camp13mac04_|Renown... I thought I have claimed my rightful share of it. But now it appears that to most, the name McGonagall speaks not of a Scottish patriot and a great poet, but of some sort of a fictional witch from a children's book...{***}
dlga_camp13mac04_:camp13mac05|Well, I for one will remember you, mister McGonagall, you and your advices.{***}
dlga_camp13mac05:camp13mac05_|Then maybe some more poetry afore you go?{***}
dlga_camp13mac05_:close_window|Uh, look, better not. See you.{***}
dlga_camp13mac05_:camp13mac06|With great pleasure.{***}
dlga_camp13mac06:camp13mac07|I must now conclude my lay^By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay{***}
dlga_camp13mac07:camp13mac08|That your central girders would not have given way,^At least many sensible men do say,{***}
dlga_camp13mac08:camp13mac09|Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,^At least many sensible men confesses,{***}
dlga_camp13mac09:camp13mac10|For the stronger we our houses do build,^The less chance we have of being killed.{***}
dlga_camp13mac10:camp13mac10_|Good bye.{***}
dlga_camp13mac10_:close_window|Farewell, sir.{***}
dlga_camp14francois00_:camp14francois02|Connection to you was the least useful for the time being.{***}
dlga_camp14francois00_:camp14francois01|Why are you alive still, monsieur?{***}
dlga_camp14francois01:camp14francois03|Oh, I am not that easy to kill. I heard of your troubles in Puerto Plata. I totally and absolutely and categorically apologise. By the way, I'd like you to meet someone.{***}
dlga_camp14francois02:camp14francois03|That was uncalled for, my friend. It is your crazy Jorge - yeah, I know of your meeting - who you need to be wary of. But we can deal with him. Let me introduce you to our remedy.{***}
dlga_camp14francois03:camp14francois03_|Zendar Van der Graaf, a talented upstart tradesman. After a certain ignominious event - not that ignominious for a Frenchman, mind you - he had to quit his job at East India Company. Now he joins our endeavor as an interested party.{***}
dlga_camp14francois03_:camp14francois04|I wonder if we have met before? Name sounds vaguely familiar.{***}
dlga_camp14francois04:camp14francois04_|His name used to be rather famous - in a foreign land, in a foreign time. Says he was named after a great ancestor. As for his family, it is quite renowned for its interest in inventions and music.{***}
dlga_camp14francois04_:camp14francois05|Got it.{***}
dlga_camp14francois05:camp14francois05_|That Jorge fellow must have mentioned him to you as your competitor, did he not? He said Zendar the same about you. We believe he is pursuing some hidden agenda, but we can keep that smug old fart in check.{***}
dlga_camp14francois05_:camp14francois06|Wait, what about the Mayan treasures?{***}
dlga_camp14francois05_:camp14francois07|Fine, what is the plan?{***}
dlga_camp14francois06:camp14francois06_|When the stars are right, {monsieur/madame}. Wouldn't you want to know our plan first?{***}
dlga_camp14francois06_:camp14francois07|Fine, what is the plan?{***}
dlga_camp14francois07:camp14francois07_|Simple enough. We know Jorge employs an enormous network of spies and informants all over the Caribbean. That's what allows him to move around the New World without a ship of his own, avoid harm on a field of battle, and arrange the deaths of those who stand on his way. Verily, he is more of a kindred to the inquisitors than a Don Quixote he loves to pose as.{***}
dlga_camp14francois07_:camp14francois08|And still no plan in sight.{***}
dlga_camp14francois08:camp14francois08_|Yes, {monsieur/madame}. It's a french plan, very detailed. Just a bit of your patience.{***}
dlga_camp14francois08_:camp14francois09|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp14francois09:camp14francois10|We will start a trading house. 'Zendar & {playername}', how does it sound, for example? It will serve you both as a cover and as a source of income. As a chairman, you'll be able to court the services of local captains, and some of them are guaranteed to be Jorge's men, I can vouch for that.{***}
dlga_camp14francois10:camp14francois10_|Come to think of it, 'Zendar' sounds so XIII century. You can't make a fortune selling cocoa beans with a name like that. Let's leave it be and name your enterprise '{playername} & Co'. That's the plan, then. Have you decided on a city to start in yet?{***}
dlga_camp14francois10_:camp14francois11|Wait wait wait! What the hell am I supposed to do?{***}
dlga_camp14francois11:camp14francois11_|The obvious stuff. Here are your starting funds, 10000 piastres total. Head to New Orleans or Curacao or wherever, buy yourself a cozy plantation and rake in the profits. Van der Graaf, explain {him/her} the specifics, {he/she} seems to be a little slower than usual today. See you later, gentlemen.{***}
dlga_camp14francois11_:close_window|Wait, I am not going to...{***}
dlga_camp15graaf00_:camp15graaf01|That would be convenient.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf00_:camp15graaf05|Please don't bother.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf00_:close_window|I was juggling millions before you have learned how to walk, sonny. Have a nice day.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf01:camp15graaf01_|People usually start their business with a purchase of a plantation, a mine or a sawmill, depending on their starting capital. As far as enterprises go, these are the most reliable ones. You get a constant stream of goods arriving at your warehouse every day, then decide what to make of it.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf01_:camp15graaf02|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp15graaf02:camp15graaf02_|Obviously, you could sell your goods right there in the city. But it is far more profitable to load them on your ships and vend elsewhere, preferably someplace where they aren't produced locally.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf02_:camp15graaf03|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp15graaf03:camp15graaf03_|Just don't forget to show up at your warehouse once in a while and do something with the stock, lest the taxes, worker wages and other expenses would run your treasury dry in no time. When you are out of funds, sooner or later the city would seize your enterprises.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf03_:camp15graaf04|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp15graaf04:camp15graaf04_|Sometimes, when a city is under attack, an enterprise therein may end up being collateral damage. Consider it a cost of the trade. So, we try our startup?{***}
dlga_camp15graaf04_:camp15graaf05|Sure thing.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf04_:camp15graaf06|Yeah, but I've got a question first.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf05:camp15graaf05_|Fine. We can try any town, but let's stay outside the Brotherhood of the Coast's turf for now, I'll explain the difference later. Let me know once you select your enterprise and finalize the deal with the city.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf05_:close_window|I will.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf06:camp15graaf06_|Which one?{***}
dlga_camp15graaf06_:camp15graaf07|How do I find that brothel in Havana?{***}
dlga_camp15graaf06_:camp15graaf08|Which goods fetch the best price?{***}
dlga_camp15graaf07:camp15graaf07_|Oh, that one... Well, if we do well enough, I might introduce you later. It's a closed club, you see.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf07_:close_window|Fine, thanks.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf08:camp15graaf08_|Can't tell really, prices and demand are shifting all the time. We'll stick to raw resources for now, manufactories producing finished goods might be too much for you to handle yet.{***}
dlga_camp15graaf08_:close_window|Fine, thanks.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf00_:camp16graaf01|Sure, go ahead.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf01:camp16graaf01_|The New World is quite unlike Europe when it comes to business. There are no guilds and patricians here, no princes to kowtow and no oldermen to grovel in front of. Still, certain silent restrictions are in action even in West India. It's rather simple really - the richer you are, the richer you'll be permitted to become.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf01_:camp16graaf02|Keep listening...{***}
dlga_camp16graaf02:camp16graaf02_|For now you are only able to expand your resource extraction enterprise. As your assets increase, the towns will permit you to build manufactories and produce finished goods. Then there are certain tricks to speed up the flow of your capitals.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf02_:camp16graaf03|You have my complete attention.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf03:camp16graaf04|Let's start with taxes. You can't avoid them, but you can walk around them. One way is the harbors controlled by buccaneers. Technically, people in Europe still think of Tortuga or Nassau as owned by France or England when they browse the maps, but we here know it better. The buccaneer towns won't tax you, they are free ports.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf04:camp16graaf05|Naturally, the governors won't like you better over marketing your goods the other side of the law, but a little palm grease goes a long way to improve relations. The other way to avoid taxation is dealing with smugglers.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf05:camp16graaf05_|Smugglers do their trade right under the nose of city guards, who can't do crap about it. The only danger may come from the customs officers, whose patrol vessels occasionally pester suspicious ships.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf05_:camp16graaf06|I'll remember that. What else?{***}
dlga_camp16graaf05_:camp16graaf07|I think I'd rather pay my taxes.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf06:camp16graaf06_|That must be all for now. My ship's leaving in an hour, so I best make my arrangements.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf06_:close_window|Thanks for this crash course. 'Til next time, associate.{***}
dlga_camp16graaf07:camp16graaf06|Most commendable aspiration. I wish I could follow it myself.{***}
dlga_camp17francois00_:camp17francois01|Francois, I still can't get your plan.{***}
dlga_camp17francois00_:close_window|Finally. I'll arrange my ship to depart at once.{***}
dlga_camp17francois01:camp17francois01_|{Monsieur/Madame}, tune down your bewilderment. The cache doesn't matter, old Flint himself and his petty treasures do not matter - what could he bury there, a couple of coins and his Norwegian Blue? No, what does matter is a clue to the Ponce de Leon's puzzle that Flint used to possess. We'll get that Jorge, oh yes we will.{***}
dlga_camp17francois01_:close_window|I'd rather peddle my spoiled grain.{***}
dlga_camp17francois01_:close_window.1|Fine, I'll arrange our departure.{***}
dlga_camp18francois00_:camp18francois01|Keep listening to his mumbo-jumbo...{***}
dlga_camp18francois01:camp18francois01_|...yes, it appears, we'd need a map. Well, you are a busy {man/woman}, {monsieur/madame}, so I'll take my leave for the time being. Try mingling around in the taverns, ask the captains, maybe one of them would have a lead.{***}
dlga_camp18francois01_:close_window|Wait, can I get some markers on my compass?!{***}
dlga_camp19francois00_:camp19francois01|Horrible! How did that happen?{***}
dlga_camp19francois00_:camp19francois03|So now I am in sole possession of our assets?{***}
dlga_camp19francois01:camp19francois02|We don't know much. Apparently Zendar Van didn't feel like paying harbor fees and arranged a meeting with the smugglers on the coast, as he is wont to do. It was dark, and his party couldn't realize the welcoming party is dressed too immodestly even for the Portuguese crooks until it was too late.{***}
dlga_camp19francois02:camp19francois02_|One man was left for breakfast, and he managed to flee in the night. It was he who told the tale about the rest of his friends being eaten. Including der Graaf. For starters, they hacked off his legs with an obsidian knive...{***}
dlga_camp19francois02_:camp19francois03|Please, no more gruesome details! So what do I do now?{***}
dlga_camp19francois03:camp19francois04|You are the head of your trading house now, in a manner of speaking. You won't inherit many assets though; the governors moved quickly and seized Van der Graaf's enterprises in their towns. All I can offer you is his share in the charter capital, 50000 piastres total.{***}
dlga_camp19francois04:camp19francois04_|You can now expand your business, or shut it down and go mercenary, whatever. Now, listen. Twelve disciples means twelve blokes hanging around the Caribbean as of late. Whoever they are, you need to find them and earn their trust. Eventually, each of them will lead you to his part of the puzzle.{***}
dlga_camp19francois04_:camp19francois05|Very well, I will continue with my business.{***}
dlga_camp19francois04_:camp19francois06|I crave vengeance!!!{***}
dlga_camp19francois05:camp19francois05_|A wise {man/woman} hath spoken, {monsieur/madame}. See you around.{***}
dlga_camp19francois05_:close_window|See you.{***}
dlga_camp19francois06:camp19francois06_|Charming. Upon whom would you dispense your revenge, though? The savages? Good luck seeking them in the jungle.{***}
dlga_camp19francois06_:camp19francois07|Doesn't matter. I'll find the bastards.{***}
dlga_camp19francois06_:camp19francois05|Sounds reasonable, alas.{***}
dlga_camp19francois07:camp19francois07_|Fine, I can give you the landmarks. The grave of young Zendar Van der Graaf is right there. Well, the grave of his less tasteful parts, that is.{***}
dlga_camp19francois07_:camp19francois08|Excellent, speak! A-crusading we shall go.{***}
dlga_camp19francois08:camp19francois08_|This is right on the border between the Dutch colonies and the Portuguese turf. The young der Graaf's grave is right by the coast. Good luck with your vengeance, {monsieur/madame}.{***}
dlga_camp19francois08_:close_window|See you.{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman00_:camp20strangeman01|Actually, yes. Do you know where the tribe of cannibals is?{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman00_:camp20strangeman02|And who might you be?{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman01:camp20strangeman03|Not around, not anymore. Neither cannibals nor otherwise. Not prepared yet, they said. But prepare they will, betcha. Beats me when though, maybe this summer, maybe earlier than that. Will run around all over the place, here, there and beyond, where Fernanda Cortes kicked'em good. Won't be pretty.{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman02:camp20strangeman02_|I, uh, just live nearby. So you lookin' for natives or nope?{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman02_:camp20strangeman01|Actually, yes. Do you know where the tribe of cannibals is?{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman03:camp20strangeman03_|So keep your cannons clean, folks. I go now.{***}
dlga_camp20strangeman03_:close_window|Wait, good sir...?{***}
dlga_camp21jorge00_:camp21jorge01|Senor Jorge, my pleasure.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge00_:camp21jorge02|Senor, I wish ill upon you.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge01:camp21jorge01_|I have an impression you were looking for me. Why? Didn't I tell you I will find you myself when the need arises? And warned you not to associate with that French senor. His schemes will be your undoing.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge01_:camp21jorge03|I don't trust Francois all that much.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge02:camp21jorge02_|Why? How did I ever harm you? I merely provided you with a ship, helped to escape a dungeon, sent you to a wise mentor. If there is any villain here, it's your buddy Francois.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge02_:camp21jorge03|I don't trust Francois all that much either.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge03:camp21jorge04|Good for you. Did you really believe he is looking for Maya treasures? He has no use for them. Truth is, Francois needs the Fountain of Youth to fuel some kind of hellish device. He believes the Fountain manifests certain unique temporal abilities and will help him to travel in time.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge04:camp21jorge04_|It's unwise to alter history, but Francois, being a man of science, believes his ratio can fix all the evils of the world. That's how such evils typically happen to begin with...{***}
dlga_camp21jorge04_:camp21jorge05|Fine, but what about Ponce de Leon?{***}
dlga_camp21jorge04_:camp21jorge06|What about you? What do you want?{***}
dlga_camp21jorge05:camp21jorge05_|I am still looking for the key to understand his mystery. But Francois was correct for once - look for the twelve disciples.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge05_:camp21jorge06|What about you? What do you want?{***}
dlga_camp21jorge06:camp21jorge06_|I just want to help you to discover a purpose you are so desperate to find.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge06_:camp21jorge07|Do you love mankind so much?{***}
dlga_camp21jorge07:camp21jorge07_|Not at all, as a matter of fact. Yet I can't help but pity you. I'd rather not elaborate, lest I recall your fencing performance in the dungeon once again, and collapse sobbing.{***}
dlga_camp21jorge07_:close_window|Whatever, senor Jorge. I am sure we'll meet again.{***}
dlga_camp22francois00_:camp22francois01|Wait, Francois, what about Jorge?{***}
dlga_camp22francois00_:camp22francois01.1|Wait, Francois, what about the Maya treasures?{***}
dlga_camp22francois01:camp22francois02|Mon cher, open your eyes. Screw the treasures, screw Jorge! Did you actually think this is some vulgar source of immortality? Think again! Eternal youth means frozen time itself! Not just a cup of water to throw some sugar into and sip through a straw. The power of time! And the Maya knew that.{***}
dlga_camp22francois02:camp22francois03|You know what's weird about the Maya? They appear to have destroyed themselves. Not even destroyed... just grew tired of living. Maybe they have discovered something? One thing is certain, their insight was far ahead of their social development, which has remained on the native level.{***}
dlga_camp22francois03:camp22francois04|The only thing I can't explain yet is how did this Fountain of Time - I like that better than some silly 'youth' - end up in Florida. Pretty far from the Mayan cities. Not like it matters...{***}
dlga_camp22francois04:camp22francois04_|Now we wield the power of time - the temporal power; and we, {monsieur/madame}, can change the world. Change the history. Will you go with me?{***}
dlga_camp22francois04_:camp22francois05|No, {monsieur/madame}. Whatever your creepy plans are, I want no part of them.{***}
dlga_camp22francois04_:camp22francois06|I will.{***}
dlga_camp22francois05:camp22francois05_|As you wish. Your refusal does not disturb me in the least. You know why? Because I have all the time in the world. Good luck, {monsieur/madame}.{***}
dlga_camp22francois05_:close_window|Yeah, whatever...{***}
dlga_camp22francois06:camp22francois06_|Excellent. Follow me.{***}
dlga_camp22francois06_:close_window|(And Hell followed with him...){***}
dlga_camp23francois00_:camp23francois01|Can I change my mind yet?{***}
dlga_camp23francois00_:camp23francois02|Very well, I am ready.{***}
dlga_camp23francois01:camp23francois03|Too late, unfortunately. Now listen.{***}
dlga_camp23francois02:camp23francois03|Great. Now listen.{***}
dlga_camp23francois03:camp23francois04|Your task is easy enough. You will appear in some kind of a dungeon. If it looks familiar to you, that is not a coincidence - you've got a chance to practice already, ha-ha.{***}
dlga_camp23francois04:camp23francois04_|There will be some unfriendly English soldiers, convince them to leave you alone. You'll find a fuse in the room above. Set a light to it, and I will bring you back. That's it.{***}
dlga_camp23francois04_:close_window|All clear. Let's do it, lad.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman00_:camp24englishman01|Mmm, tasty.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman00_:camp24englishman02|Another madman...{***}
dlga_camp24englishman01:camp24englishman03|Like it? Have some more. You see, Francois is sort of a companion of mine. A temporary one. Bah, our relationship with time is kinda confusing... Anyway, he made a mistake once, and now he wants you to make one, too.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman02:camp24englishman03|I am a traveller, not a madman. Just like you. You see, Francois is sort of a companion of mine. A temporary one. Bah, our relationship with time is kinda confusing... Anyway, he made a mistake once, and now he wants you to make one, too.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman03:camp24englishman03_|He took the stories about bisons going extinct and of the resettlement of Acadian population to Louisiana too close to his heart, and now blames Anglo-Saxon world for everything. An incredibly naive fallacy. Trust me, you don't want to set that fuse alight.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman03_:camp24englishman04|But I have to.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman03_:camp24englishman04.1|Very well. Somehow I trust you.{***}
dlga_camp24englishman04:camp24englishman04_|Look! Behind you!{***}
dlga_camp24englishman04_:close_window|Where?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge00_:camp25jorge01|Good day, senor Jorge.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge00_:camp25jorge01.1|Fine, I guess. Physically, anyway. Not so sure about my mental state.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge01:camp25jorge01_|Having realized your purpose, how do you feel about it? About being immortal.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge01_:camp25jorge02|I am not sure. Define 'immortal'.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge01_:camp25jorge05|I feel awesome, what else?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge02:camp25jorge03|Isn't it obvious? Immortality means an impossibility to die. You can engage in all sorts of dangerous adventures, charge against all odds, and never know the kiss of death.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge03:camp25jorge04|Sure, you can end up being imprisoned, or wounded, or robbed. But death - you have cheated her once and for all.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge04:camp25jorge04_|I am afraid the curse of Ponce de Leon is now upon you. You'll never be able to leave the Caribbean again. The western reaches of the Atlantic is as far as you can go. There is no place for you in the Old World any more.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge04_:camp25jorge06|This sounds terrible. What do I do now?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge05:camp25jorge05_|Glad to hear. I believe my mission with you is over now, and a success. Go, my friend, the azure waters of the Caribbean are waiting for you.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge05_:close_window|Farewell, Jorge.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge06:camp25jorge06_|What do you do? You used to have a purpose, then you have realized it. Well, find another.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge06_:camp25jorge07|The way you say it... I think I was immortal right from the start.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge07:camp25jorge07_|It doesn't matter. You still had a purpose. Look for a new one.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge07_:camp25jorge08|No. I want to break this curse.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge08:camp25jorge08_|Excuse me, senor, it wasn't in the rules. You have grasped the greatest treasure a man could wish for - life eternal - and you want to cast it aside?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge08_:camp25jorge09|Such is my wish... There is nothing left for me in this tiny self-contained world, and I want to tear asunder. I want to make it so that I may look upon this existence with renewed zest. I long for new purposes and new boundaries.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge09:camp25jorge09_|Is that so? Then listen to me, senor. And listen CAREFULLY.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge09_:camp25jorge10|(Listen CAREFULLY...){***}
dlga_camp25jorge10:camp25jorge10_|I've got two options for you. One could fill your world with new purposes, but that depends on you. Another would destroy this world, and you will never be able to repair the damage. What do you choose?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge10_:camp25jorge11|I will look for the new purposes.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge10_:camp25jorge16|Burn, baby, burn!{***}
dlga_camp25jorge11:camp25jorge12|Look, this entire region is constantly at war. Why won't you enlist with one of European powers and lead it to victory?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge12:camp25jorge13|This is going to challenge you for a while, particularly if you side with the Dutch. That, or go join the buccaneers and make sure anarchy and chaos reign the Caribbean for years to come.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge13:camp25jorge14|Try to make your first billion of piastres. Or make it so that your trading house produces every kind of goods possible and is present in every city.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge14:camp25jorge14_|Not quite saving the world or looking for a missing father, but good enough a purpose nonetheless, no?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge14_:close_window|Perhaps you are right. Thank you, Jorge, I will consider that.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge14_:camp25jorge15|No. These purposes are awful, simply awful.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge15:camp25jorge15_|Then I have nothing more to suggest. Farewell.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge15_:close_window|But...{***}
dlga_camp25jorge16:camp25jorge17|Look, what you see is a computer game based on the Mount & Blade Warband Engine. It was supposed to feature more strategic elements, not all of them made it in.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge17:camp25jorge17_|The development will continue, however. There will be more options soon. Perhaps it will be the native tribes a man in the jungle could have told you about. Perhaps some new ways to manage and upgrade cities.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge17_:camp25jorge18|How long do I have to wait?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge17_:camp25jorge19|What about multiplayer?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge18:camp25jorge18_|A few months, methinks. Depends on when exactly will you read these words.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge18_:camp25jorge20|Jorge, why are you telling this to me?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge19:camp25jorge19_|Multiplayer is planned and will likely be implemented. Not that soon, though.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge19_:camp25jorge20|Jorge, why are you telling this to me?{***}
dlga_camp25jorge20:camp25jorge20_|To keep your spirits up, my friend. Many will hear of this conversation, but few will partake in it. Feels good to be among the few.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge20_:camp25jorge21|Thank you, Jorge.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge21:camp25jorge21_|Thank you, {playername}. I will contact you when I have news to tell. Suddenly, as always.{***}
dlga_camp25jorge21_:close_window|See you later!{***}
dlga_camp08jorge14_:camp08jorge01|Bloody rascals interrupted such an entertaining conversation about Aztec gold...{***}
dlga_lord_recruit_caribbian:lord_recruit_pledge|That much is true, they have offended me greatly. Now that you mention it, I could use new friends indeed... I take it you want me to support this crazy enterprise of yours? That could prove interesting.{***}
dlga_cardplayer_begin_:cardplayer_suggest|Can you suggest someone to play with?{***}
dlga_cardplayer_begin_:close_window|Deal me some.{***}
dlga_cardplayer_begin_:close_window.1|I guess I should leave now.{***}
dlga_cardplayer_pretalk:cardplayer_begin_|Anything else?{***}
dlga_cardplayer_suggest:cardplayer_pretalk|{s50}{***}
